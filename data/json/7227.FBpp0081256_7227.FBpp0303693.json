This enhancer is sufficient to direct the female-specific transcription characteristic of the Yp genes in adult fat bodies. Involved in regulation of male- specific expression of takeout in brain-associated fat body",
    "annotationB": "Protein sex-lethal; Sex determination switch protein which controls sexual development by sex-specific splicing. Regulates dosage compensation in females by suppressing hyperactivation of X-linked genes. Expression of the embryo-specific isoform is under the control of primary sex-determining signal, which depends on the ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes (X:A ratio). Expression occurs in 2X:2A cells, but not in X:2A cells. The X:A ratio seems to be signaled by the relative concentration of the X- linked transcription factors SIS-A and SIS-B. As a result, the embryo-specific  [...] ",
