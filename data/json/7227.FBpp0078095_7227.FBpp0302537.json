Acts by directing the binding of methionyl-tRNAi to 40S ribosomal subunits. In contrast to the eIF- 2 complex, it binds methionyl-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a codon- dependent manner, whereas the eIF-2 complex binds methionyl-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a GTP-dependent manner. May act by impiging the expression of specific proteins (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 3; eIF-2 functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA. This complex binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by mRNA binding to form a 43S pre-initiation complex. Junction of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex is preceded by hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF-2 and release of an eIF-2- GDP binary complex. In order for eIF-2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF-2 must exchange with GTP by way of a reaction catal [...] ",
