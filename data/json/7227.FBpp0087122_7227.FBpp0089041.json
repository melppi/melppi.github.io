Binds to ODC monomers, inhibiting the assembly of the functional ODC homodimer, and targets the monomers for ubiquitin- independent proteolytic destruction by the 26S proteasome (By similarity). Required for cellular differentiation in neuronal and myogenic lineages during embryonic development . ",
