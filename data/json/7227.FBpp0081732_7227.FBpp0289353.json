    "annotationA": "Homeobox protein homothorax; All isoforms are required for patterning of the embryonic cuticle. Acts with exd to delimit the eye field and prevent inappropriate eye development. Isoforms that carry the homeodomain are required for proper localization of chordotonal organs within the peripheral nervous system and antennal identity; required to activate antennal-specific genes, such as sal and to repress the leg-like expression of dac. Necessary for the nuclear localization of the essential HOX cofactor, extradenticle (exd). Both necessary and sufficient for inner photoreceptors to adopt [...] ",

Specifies the identity of ventral appendages (including legs and antennae) and suppresses dorsal appendage development. Involved in patterning the distal-proximal limb axis. May control the adhesive properties of cells during limb morphogenesis. Also has a secondary role in the normal patterning of the wing margin",
