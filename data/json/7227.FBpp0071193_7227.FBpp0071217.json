Required for early nucleolar cleavages of precursor rRNA at sites A0, A1 and A2 during 18S rRNA synthesis. Catalyzes the formation of ac4C in serine and leucine tRNAs. Requires a tRNA-binding adapter protein for full tRNA acetyltransferase activity but not for 18S rRNA acetylation (Probable). Polycomb group (PcG) protein.
