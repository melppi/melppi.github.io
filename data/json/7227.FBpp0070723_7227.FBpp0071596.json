    "annotationA": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk) is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity depends on the regulatory CycH and Mat1 subunits. This trimeric Cdk complex activates other Cdks by phosphorylation in their T-loop and is called Cdk activating kinase (CAK). CAK can also be part of TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates different transcription substrates (e.g. CTD of Pol II)",
    "annotationB": "TATA binding protein is a basal transcription factor required at most RNA Pol I and Pol II-transcribed genes in Drosophila. Traditionally thought to be recruited only to TATA box containing promoters, recent work shows that promoters with very weak TATA box consensus sequences also recruit TBP as a part of the multisubunit TFIID basal transcription factor or via the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex",
