Binds to the promoter region of the homeobox gene Abd-B and is involved in maintaining Abd-B expression in the pupal epithelium. Involved in the transcriptional repression of the homeotic genes Scr and Ubx. Plays a role in meiotic recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks which ensures efficient translation of grk and promotes grk activity in the oocyte, leading to oocyte dorso-ventral axis formation follow [...] ",
