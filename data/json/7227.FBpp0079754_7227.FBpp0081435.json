Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. In ovary, associates predominantly with antisense piRNAs that contain uridine at their 5' end. In testis, associates with  [...] ",
