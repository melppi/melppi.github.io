    "annotationA": "Protein LST8 homolog; Subunit of TORC1 and TORC2, which regulate cell growth and survival in response to nutrient and hormonal signals. Essential for TORC2-mediated regulation of cell growth and phosphorylation of Akt1. However it is not required for TORC1-mediated functions such as TORC1-dependent regulation of cell growth, autophagy and phosphorylation of S6K; Belongs to the WD repeat LST8 family",
