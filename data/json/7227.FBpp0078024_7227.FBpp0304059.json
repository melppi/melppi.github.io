Rpn10 recognizes and binds the polyubiquitin moiety of proteins intended for proteasomal degradation or the ubiquitin-like domain of extraproteasomal ubiquitin receptors",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin specific protease 14 (Usp14) is a deubiquitinase that associates with the 19S component of the proteasome in a reversible manner. Usp14 functions include ubiquitin chain disassemblance for mono-ubiquitin recycling, control of protein degradation by the proteasome and regulation of proteasome subtrate interactions; Belongs to the peptidase C19 family",
