    "annotationA": "PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation complex subunit PAN3; Regulatory subunit of the poly(A)-nuclease (PAN) deadenylation complex, one of two cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylases involved in general and miRNA-mediated mRNA turnover. PAN specifically shortens poly(A) tails of RNA and the activity is stimulated by poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). PAN deadenylation is followed by rapid degradation of the shortened mRNA tails by the CCR4-NOT complex. Deadenylated mRNAs are then degraded by two alternative mechanisms, namely exosome-mediated 3'-5' exonucleolytic degradation, or deadenlyation-dependent mRNA deca [...] ",

It is a component of the eIF4F cap-binding complex that is essential for cap-dependent translation of mRNA. eIF4E-3 is primarily expressed in testes and is required for male fertility, but not for viability",
