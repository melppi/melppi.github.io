Acts as a negative regulator of the NF-kappa-B (rel) signaling pathway. Cact is degraded by ird5, this is essential for NF-kappa-B (rel) activation",
    "annotationB": "Kurtz, isoform A; Kurtz (Krz) is a beta-arrestin (non-visual arrestin) involved in the desensitization and endocytic internalization of G protein coupled receptors, thus downregulating their activity. Krz also controls other signaling pathways, including Notch, receptor tyrosine kinase, Hedgehog, and Toll. It is required maternally for normal embryonic patterning and zygotically for larval viability",
