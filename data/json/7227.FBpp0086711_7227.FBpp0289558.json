    "annotationA": "Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 catalytic subunit; Catalytic subunit of the dimeric Uba3-APP-BP1 E1 enzyme. E1 activates Nedd8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a Nedd8-Uba3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers Nedd8 to the catalytic cysteine of Ubc12. Required for Cul1 and Cul3 neddylation. Negatively regulates full-length ci stability and hedgehog signaling",
