    "annotationA": "3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: fatty acid biosynthetic process; Belongs to the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases family",
    "annotationB": "Enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase, mitochondrial; Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of trans-2-enoyl thioesters in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (fatty acid synthesis type II). Fatty acid chain elongation in mitochondria uses acyl carrier protein (ACP) as an acyl group carrier, but the enzyme accepts both ACP and CoA thioesters as substrates in vitro; Belongs to the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase family. Quinone oxidoreductase subfamily",
