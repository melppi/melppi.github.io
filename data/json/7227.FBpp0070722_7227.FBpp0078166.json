    "annotationB": "Thioredoxin reductase 2, mitochondrial; Thioredoxin system is a major player in glutathione metabolism, due to the demonstrated absence of a glutathione reductase. Functionally interacts with the Sod/Cat reactive oxidation species (ROS) defense system and thereby has a role in preadult development and life span. Lack of a glutathione reductase suggests antioxidant defense in Drosophila, and probably in related insects, differs fundamentally from that in other organisms; Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family",
