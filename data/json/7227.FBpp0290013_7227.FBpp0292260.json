Essential for embryonic viability and development. Required for coordinated peristaltic contractions. Recruited by Unc-13-4B to secretory lysosome-related organelles (SLs) that are essential for tracheal lumen fusion between previously separate tracheal branches (anastomosis). Possibly promotes the intracellular fusion of the extending tracheal stalk cell lumens  [...] ",
