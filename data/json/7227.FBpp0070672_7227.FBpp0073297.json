It homodimerizes and binds to a variety of proteins. It is involved in both dynein-dependent and independent functions such as cell viability, axonal guidance, spermatid growth and individualization, and regulation of spermatogonial divisions; Belongs to the dynein light chain family",
    "annotationB": "Dynein light intermediate chain, isoform A; Microtubule motor activity; motor activity; ATPase activity, coupled. It is involved in the biological process described with: mitotic nuclear division; axonogenesis; oogenesis; regulation of dendrite morphogenesis; mRNA transport; mitotic spindle organization; axon cargo transport; microtubule cytoskeleton organization; dendrite morphogenesis; microtubule-based movement",
