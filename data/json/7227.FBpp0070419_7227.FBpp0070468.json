    "annotationA": "Zeste is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. It is often found in the proximal promoter region of many genes where it helps to recruit the BRM nucleosome remodeling complex. It is best known for the pairing-dependent repressive effects produced by some of its mutants on target genes, especially the w gene",
    "annotationB": "Protein white; Part of a membrane-spanning permease system necessary for the transport of pigment precursors into pigment cells responsible for eye color. White dimerize with brown for the transport of guanine. Scarlet and white complex transports a metabolic intermediate (such as 3-hydroxy kynurenine) from the cytoplasm into the pigment granules",
