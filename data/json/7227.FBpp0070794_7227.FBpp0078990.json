Dosage compensation insures that males with a single X chromosome have the same amount of most X-linked gene products as females with two X chromosomes. May be directly involved in the acetylation of histone 4 at 'Lys- 16' on the X chromosome of males where it is recruited by the MSL complex. As part of the NSL complex may associate with promoters of X chromosomal as well as autosomal genes and positive [...] ",
