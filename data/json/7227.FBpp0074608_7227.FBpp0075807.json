    "annotationA": "Serine/threonine-protein kinase polo; May play a role in regulating both nuclear and cytoplasmic aspects of the mitotic cycle. Regulates localization of the augmin complex during mitosis by ensuring its location on mitotic spindles. Also regulates augmin complex localization during male meiosis by promoting its placement at kinetochores while preventing its association with spindle microtubules",
    "annotationB": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-A; Cyclin A (CycA) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",
