    "annotationA": "RuvB-like helicase 1; Acts as a transcriptional coactivator in Wg signaling caused by altered arm signaling. Pont and rept interfere antagonistically with nuclear arm signaling function, and are required to enhance or reduce arm activity, respectively. Also an essential cofactor for the normal function of Myc; required for cellular proliferation and growth",
    "annotationB": "Armadillo segment polarity protein; Isoform neural may associate with CadN and participate in the transmission of developmental information. Can associate with alpha-catenin. Isoform cytoplasmic accumulates through wg signaling; arm function in wg signal transduction is required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Arm and Abl proteins function cooperatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and epidermis; Belongs to the beta-catenin family",
