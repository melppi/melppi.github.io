    "annotationA": "Probable deoxyhypusine synthase; Catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidative cleavage of spermidine and the subsequent transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the eIF-5A precursor protein to form the intermediate deoxyhypusine residue",
    "annotationB": "Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase; Catalyzes the hydroxylation of the N(6)-(4-aminobutyl)- L-lysine intermediate to form hypusine, an essential post- translational modification only found in mature eIF-5A factor (By similarity). Essential for organismal viability and plays a role in a wide number of important processes such as cell growth and proliferation, and regulates induction of autophagy and protein synthesis. Has a role in eIF-5A-mediated translational control; Belongs to the deoxyhypusine hydroxylase family",
