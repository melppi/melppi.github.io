The CBC complex is involved in miRNA-mediated RNA interference via its interaction with Ars2 and is required for primary microRNAs (miRNAs) processing. Also involved in innate immunity via the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processing machinery by restricting the viral RNA production. In the CBC complex, Cbp20 recognizes and binds capped RNAs  [...] ",

Involved in innate immunity via the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processing machinery by restricting the viral RNA production. Also involved microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing by contributing to the stability and delivery of primary miRNA transcripts to the primary miRNA processing complex containing drosha and pasha; Belongs to the ARS2 family",
