NURF is required for homeotic gene expression, proper larval blood cell development, normal male X chromosome morphology, ecdysteroid signaling and metamorphosis. Nurf-38 may have adapted to deliver pyrophosphatase to chromatin to assist in replication or transcription by efficient removal of the inhibitory metabolite; Belongs to the PPase family",

Component of several complexes which regulate chromatin metabolism. These include the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, which is required for chromatin assembly following DNA replication and DNA repair; the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (the NuRD complex), which promotes transcriptional repression by histone deacetylati [...] ",
