Plays a role in vesicle-mediated protein trafficking to lysosomal compartments and in membrane docking/fusion reactions of late endosomes/lysosomes. Required to maintain normal levels of rush, which functions in endosome formation and trafficking",
    "annotationB": "Caffeine, calcium, zinc sensitivity 1 (Ccz1) forms a complex with Mon1 and acts as an exchange factor of the small G-protein Rab7. The Ccz1/Mon1 complex activates and recruits Rab7 to the maturing endosome, where Rab7 organizes the fusion of the matured endosome with the lysosome. Ccz1/Mon1 complex loss of function results in Rab7 phenotypes",
