Dbt reduces the stability and thus the accumulation of monomeric per proteins, probably through phosphorylation. No evident circadian oscillation is detected in head. Together with CkIalpha, regulates processing of ci by phosphorylating it which promotes its binding to slmb, the F-box recognition component of the SCF(slmb) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.
