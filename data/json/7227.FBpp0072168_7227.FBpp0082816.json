    "annotationA": "7-methylguanosine phosphate-specific 5'-nucleotidase; Specifically hydrolyzes 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (m(7)GMP) to 7-methylguanosine and inorganic phosphate. Also able to mediate hydrolysis of diphosphate (m(7)GDP) to 7-methylguanosine and 2 inorganic phosphate with lower activity. The specific activity for m(7)GMP may protect cells against undesired salvage of m(7)GMP and its incorporation into nucleic acids. Also has weak activity for CMP. UMP and purine nucleotides are poor substrates; Belongs to the pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase family",
    "annotationB": "N6-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)AMP AMP-lyase (fumarate-forming) activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: purine ribonucleotide biosynthetic process; purine nucleotide metabolic process; Belongs to the lyase 1 family. Adenylosuccinate lyase subfamily",
