    "annotationA": "Phagocyte signaling-impaired protein; Non-catalytic subunit of the NatB complex which catalyzes acetylation of the N-terminal methionine residues of proteins beginning with Met-Asp or Met-Glu (By similarity). Has 2 roles in the larval immune response: required both for the phagocytic degradation of internalized bacteria and for the induction of Defensin in the fat body. Within the phagocytic blood cells, has a role in detection of infection and activation of the humoral immune response",
    "annotationB": "Probable N-acetyltransferase san; N-alpha-acetyltransferase that acetylates the N-terminus of proteins that retain their initiating methionine (By similarity). Has a broad substrate specificity: able to acetylate the initiator methionine of most peptides (By similarity). Also displays N-epsilon-acetyltransferase activity by mediating acetylation of the side chain of specific lysines on proteins. Autoacetylates. Required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and couple the processes of cohesion and DNA replication to ensure that only sister chromatids become paired together [...] ",
