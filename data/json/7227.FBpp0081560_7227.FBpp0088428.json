    "annotationB": "Cytoplasmic dynein 1 intermediate chain; Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. The intermediate chains mediate the help dynein bind to dynactin 150 kDa component (By similarity)",
