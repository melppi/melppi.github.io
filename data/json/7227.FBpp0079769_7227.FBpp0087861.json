AurB plays multiple roles in mitosis including the correction of erroneous chromosome-spindle interactions, chromosome condensation, kinetochore assembly, spindle assembly checkpoint and cytokinesis; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Aurora subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore complex protein Nup50; Component of the nuclear pore complex that has a direct role in nuclear protein import (By similarity). Actively displaces NLSs from importin-alpha, and facilitates disassembly of the importin-alpha:beta-cargo complex and importin recycling (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active chromatin sites when located in the nucleoplasm and is involved in transcriptional activation",
