    "annotationB": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit L; Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is involved in protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs and, together with other initiation factors, stimulates binding of mRNA and methionyl-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation",
