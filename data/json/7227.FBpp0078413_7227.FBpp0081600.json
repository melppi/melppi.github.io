It is involved in the biological process described with: positive regulation of Ras protein signal transduction; protein phosphorylation; tracheal outgrowth, open tracheal system; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade; imaginal disc-derived wing morphogenesis; torso signaling pathway; anterior/posterior axis specification, embryo; Ras protein signal transduction; signal transduction",
    "annotationB": "Ras-like protein 1; Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). Plays a role in eye development by regulating cell growth, survival of postmitotic ommatidial cells and differentiation of photoreceptor cells. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, a hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis",
