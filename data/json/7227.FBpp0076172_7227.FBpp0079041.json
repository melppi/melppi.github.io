During this step, the ribosome changes from the pre-translocational (PRE) to the post-translocational (POST) state as the newly formed A- site-bound peptidyl-tRNA and P-site-bound deacylated tRNA move to the P and E sites, respectively. Catalyzes the coordinated movement of the two tRNA molecules, the mRNA and conformational changes in the ribosome (By similarity).
