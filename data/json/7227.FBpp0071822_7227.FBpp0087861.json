During late metaphase of mitosis and continuing in G1, CycB is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity, and allowing termination of mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore complex protein Nup50; Component of the nuclear pore complex that has a direct role in nuclear protein import (By similarity). Actively displaces NLSs from importin-alpha, and facilitates disassembly of the importin-alpha:beta-cargo complex and importin recycling (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active chromatin sites when located in the nucleoplasm and is involved in transcriptional activation",
