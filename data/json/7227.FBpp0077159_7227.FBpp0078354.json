    "annotationA": "Ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40; Ubiquitin: exists either covalently attached to another protein, or free (unanchored). When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-48-linked is involve [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Ribosomal protein L13A (RpL13A) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit, and thus involved in mRNA translation. Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins affect fertility, viability and other Drosophila phenotypes, described as Minute. Extra-ribosomal roles for RpL13A have been described in some organisms; Belongs to the universal ribosomal protein uL13 family",
