TfIIEalpha, together with TfIIEbeta, is essential for transcription initiation in vitro and acts with RNA polymerase II and the other general transcription factors",
    "annotationB": "General transcription factor IIF subunit 2; TFIIF is a general transcription initiation factor that binds to RNA polymerase II and helps to recruit it to the initiation complex in collaboration with TFIIB. It promotes transcription elongation. This subunit shows ATP-dependent DNA- helicase activity (By similarity)",
