    "annotationA": "Possible lysine-specific histone demethylase 1; Probable histone demethylase that specifically demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation, thereby acting as a corepressor. Required for heterochromatic gene silencing. Acts by oxidizing the substrate by FAD to generate the corresponding imine that is subsequently hydrolyzed. Demethylates both mono- and tri- methylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3. May also demethylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3, Plays a role in the repression of neuronal genes; Belongs to the flavin monoamine oxidase family",
    "annotationB": "Suppressor of hairless protein; Transcriptional regulator that plays a central role in Notch signaling, a signaling pathway involved in cell-cell communication that regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate determinations. Binds directly the 5'-GTGRGAR-3' DNA consensus sequence, which is present in the regulatory region of several genes. Required for neurogenesis in imaginal disks. Acts as a transcriptional repressor when it is not associated with Notch proteins. When associated with some Notch protein, it acts as a transcriptional activator that activates transcription of Notch target g [...] ",
