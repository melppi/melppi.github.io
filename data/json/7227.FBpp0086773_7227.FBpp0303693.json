Involved in the female- specific splicing of Sxl transcripts. Required for proper inclusion of regulated exons in Ubx transcripts, leading to isoforms Ia/b and IIa/b; Belongs to the fl(2)d family",
    "annotationB": "Protein sex-lethal; Sex determination switch protein which controls sexual development by sex-specific splicing. Regulates dosage compensation in females by suppressing hyperactivation of X-linked genes. Expression of the embryo-specific isoform is under the control of primary sex-determining signal, which depends on the ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes (X:A ratio). Expression occurs in 2X:2A cells, but not in X:2A cells. The X:A ratio seems to be signaled by the relative concentration of the X- linked transcription factors SIS-A and SIS-B. As a result, the embryo-specific  [...] ",
