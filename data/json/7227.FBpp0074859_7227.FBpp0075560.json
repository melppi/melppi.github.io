    "annotationB": "Vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36; Component of the ESCRT-II complex (ensodomal sorting complex required for transport II), which is required for multivesicular body (MVB) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity). ESCRT-II interacts, through the Vps36 subunit, with bicoid mRNA. This interaction is required for the anterior localization of bicoid m [...] ",
