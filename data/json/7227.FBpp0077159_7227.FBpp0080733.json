When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-48-linked is involve [...] ",
    "annotationB": "NEDD8; Ubiquitin-like protein which plays an important role in cell cycle control, embryogenesis and neurogenesis. Covalent attachment to its substrates requires prior activation by the E1 complex Uba3-Ula1 and linkage to the E2 enzyme Ubc12. Attachment of Nedd8 to cullins activates their associated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and thus promotes polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclins and other regulatory proteins",
