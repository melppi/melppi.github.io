    "annotationB": "12 kDa FK506-binding protein; PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. Binds to ligand-free TGF beta type I receptor, from which it is released upon a ligand-induced, type II receptor mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor. Binding is inhibitory to the signaling pathways of the TGF beta family ligands",
