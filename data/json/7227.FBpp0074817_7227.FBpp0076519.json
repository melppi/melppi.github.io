    "annotationA": "Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein 1; Plays a key role in innate immunity by acting as a pattern recognition receptor for beta-1,3-glucan from fungi and lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria. Upon recognition of invading micro-organism-derived products, acts upstream of protease spz processing enzyme SPE to activate the Toll pathway and to induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides drosomycin, cecropin and attacin",
    "annotationB": "Peptidoglycan-recognition protein SD; Peptidoglycan-recognition protein that plays a key role in innate immnunity by binding to peptidoglycans (PGN) of Gram- positive bacteria and activating the Toll pathway. Has no activity against on Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Shows some partial redundancy with PRPGP-SA in Gram-positive bacteria recognition. May act by activating the proteolytic cleavage of Spatzle and the subsequent activation of Toll pathway. Recognizes S.aureus PGN; Belongs to the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase 2 family",
