Binds directly the 5'-GTGRGAR-3' DNA consensus sequence, which is present in the regulatory region of several genes. Required for neurogenesis in imaginal disks. Acts as a transcriptional repressor when it is not associated with Notch proteins. When associated with some Notch protein, it acts as a transcriptional activator that activates transcription of Notch target g [...] ",
