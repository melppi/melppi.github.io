    "annotationA": "Protein wingless; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Segment polarity protein. May be a growth factor. Acts on neighboring cells to regulate at least one gene, the homeobox segmentation gene engrailed. Wg signal represses arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of engrailed autoactivation. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation. Wg also acts in the developing epidermis. Acts as a morphogen, [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Myc protein; Participates in the regulation of gene transcription. Binds DNA in a non-specific manner, yet also specifically recognizes the core sequence CAC[GA]TG. Seems to activate the transcription of growth-related genes; required for cellular proliferation and growth. Functions in the TORC2- mediated regulation of cell growth, acting downstream of the TORC2 complex. Inhibits the demethylase activity of Lid. Activates transcription of mbm. Able to induce the SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase member archipelago (ago) which functions in its degradation. It may therefore create a negati [...] ",
