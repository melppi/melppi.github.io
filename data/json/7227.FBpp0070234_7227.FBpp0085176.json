    "annotationA": "Activating transcription factor 3; Transcription factor which binds to the cAMP response element (CRE). Regulates metabolic and innate immune homeostasis, possibly by controlling appropriate expression of genes involved in peritrophic matrix composition and ensuring the normal digestive and immune function of the gut. Required for the expression of odorant receptors Or43b and Or47b; Belongs to the bZIP family. ATF subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog; Medea (Med) belongs to the highly conserved Smad family. Med can bind its siblings Mad or Smox to facilitate signal transduction for dpp or Activin ligands in the TGF-beta family. Med-complexes function as transcriptional regulators. Many developmental roles include dorsal-ventral patterning, patterning and proliferation of the wing disc and gene expression in the mushroom body of the larval brain",
