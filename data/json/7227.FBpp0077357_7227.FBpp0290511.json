Essential for interhomolog gene conversion (GC), but may have a less important role in intersister GC than spn-A/Rad51. In the presence of DNA, spn-A/Rad51 enhances the ATPase activity of okr/Rad54",
    "annotationB": "Structure-specific endonuclease subunit SLX1 homolog; Catalytic subunit of a heterodimeric structure-specific endonuclease that resolves DNA secondary structures generated during DNA repair and recombination. Has endonuclease activity towards branched DNA substrates, introducing single-strand cuts in duplex DNA close to junctions with ss-DNA; Belongs to the SLX1 family",
