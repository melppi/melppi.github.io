In developing imaginal disks, involved in regulating both the protein levels and apical localization of ft and ds. Involved in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) along the anterior- posterior axis of the wing (the early Fz signaling event), probably by acting upstream of ds and ft to regulate Fz activity",
