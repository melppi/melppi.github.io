    "annotationA": "Protein deltex; Regulator of Notch signaling, a signaling pathway involved in cell-cell communications that regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate determinations. Mainly acts as a positive regulator of Notch, but it may also act as a negative regulator, depending on the developmental and cell context. Mediates the antineural activity of Notch. May function as a ubiquitin ligase protein in the Notch pathway; Belongs to the Deltex family",
    "annotationB": "Kurtz, isoform A; Kurtz (Krz) is a beta-arrestin (non-visual arrestin) involved in the desensitization and endocytic internalization of G protein coupled receptors, thus downregulating their activity. Krz also controls other signaling pathways, including Notch, receptor tyrosine kinase, Hedgehog, and Toll. It is required maternally for normal embryonic patterning and zygotically for larval viability",
