    "annotationA": "Polycomb protein Scm; Polycomb group (PcG) protein. PcG proteins act by forming multiprotein complexes, which are required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development. PcG proteins are not required to initiate repression, but to maintain it during later stages of development. They probably act via the methylation of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility; Belongs to the SCM family",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase calypso; Polycomb group (PcG) protein. Catalytic component of the PR-DUB complex, a complex that specifically mediates deubiquitination of histone H2A monoubiquitinated at 'Lys-118' (H2AK118ub1). Does not deubiquitinate monoubiquitinated histone H2B. Required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development. The PR-DUB complex has weak or no activity toward 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains; Belongs to the peptidase C12 family. BAP1 subfamily",
