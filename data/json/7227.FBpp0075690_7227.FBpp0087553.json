    "annotationA": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by initiating polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, leading to the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
    "annotationB": "RE12958p; Dacapo (Dap) is a Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in the CIP/KIP family. It binds to CycE-Cdk2 complexes and thereby inhibits their protein kinase activity. Upregulation of Dap is required after the last mitosis for arresting cells in G1/G0 before terminal differentiation in many post-mitotic cell types",
