    "annotationA": "Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; Heme-dependent dioxygenase that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the L-tryptophan (L-Trp) pyrrole ring and converts L- tryptophan to N-formyl-L-kynurenine. Catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the indole moiety. Required during larval growth to control the level of potentially harmful free tryptophan in the hemolymph. In the adult the same reaction is the first step in the ommochrome biosynthetic pathway",
    "annotationB": "Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase; Catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to dopamine, L-5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and L-tryptophan to tryptamine. Variation in the synthesis of bioamines may be a factor contributing to natural variation in life span; Belongs to the group II decarboxylase family",
