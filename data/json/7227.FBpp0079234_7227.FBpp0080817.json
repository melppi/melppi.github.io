Required for embryonic segmentation, dorsal-ventral patterning and gastrulation. Required for chitin orientation and shaping of the apical and lateral plasma membranes of epidermal cells during cuticle differentiation. Also required for correctly shaping apical membrane topology of the epithelia of other organs such as the midgut and the hindgut",
    "annotationB": "Probable dolichol-phosphate mannosyltransferase; Transfers mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol monophosphate to form dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) which is the mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane anchoring, and O- mannosylation of proteins; Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family",
