Enhances 26S proteasome function by promoting its assembly through the interaction with the assembly chaperones PSMD9 and PMSD5. Functions together with ntc to control non-apoptotic caspase activation during sperm individualization. In testis, is required for proper protein degradation and germline cell cycle progression",
