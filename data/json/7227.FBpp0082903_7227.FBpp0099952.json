    "annotationA": "Slalom (Sll) is the first transporter of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), and transfers PAPS from cytosol into the lumen of Golgi. Sll roles include the sulfation of glycans and proteins, the regulation of several signaling pathways (Hh, Wingless) mediated by glycosaminoglycans during patterning and morphogenesis, and the determination of the embryonic dorsal/ventral axis; Belongs to the nucleotide-sugar transporter family. SLC35B subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Exostosin-2; Glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of heparan-sulfate and responsible for the alternating addition of beta-1-4-linked glucuronic acid (GlcA) and alpha-1-4-linked N- acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units to nascent heparan sulfate chains. Plays a central role in diffusion of morphogens hedgehog (hh), wingless (wg) and Decapentaplegic (dpp) via its role in heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) biosynthesis, HSPGs being required for movement of Hh, Dpp and wg morphogens",
