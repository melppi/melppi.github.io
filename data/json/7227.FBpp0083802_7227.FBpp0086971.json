    "annotationA": "Ribosomal protein S3 (RpS3) is a component of the small subunit of cytoplasmic ribosomes, which translate mRNAs encoded by the nuclear genome. The gene is haploinsufficient - heterozygous mutants display the 'Minute' phenotype, characterized by a slower developmental rate and small adult bristles. RpS3 also contains a DNA lyase activity and functions in DNA repair",
    "annotationB": "Nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha; May promote appropriate targeting of ribosome-nascent polypeptide complexes (By similarity). Required for correct localization of the osk/oskar protein to the posterior pole during embryonic development. The osk protein directs the recruitment of molecules responsible for posterior body patterning and germline formation in the embryo",
