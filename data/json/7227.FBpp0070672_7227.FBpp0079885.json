It homodimerizes and binds to a variety of proteins. It is involved in both dynein-dependent and independent functions such as cell viability, axonal guidance, spermatid growth and individualization, and regulation of spermatogonial divisions; Belongs to the dynein light chain family",

Rab3 proteins are involved in regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones. Rab3 GTPase-activating complex specifically converts active Rab3-GTP to the inactive form Rab3-GDP (By similarity)",
