AurB plays multiple roles in mitosis including the correction of erroneous chromosome-spindle interactions, chromosome condensation, kinetochore assembly, spindle assembly checkpoint and cytokinesis; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Aurora subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Ran GTPase-activating protein; GTPase activator for the nuclear Ras-related regulatory protein Ran, converting it to the putatively inactive GDP-bound state (By similarity). Trans-acting factor necessary for meiotic distortion. Distortion is only seen in individuals that carry the RanGAP tandem duplication and express a RanGAP truncated protein. Binding of truncated RanGAP product to the Responder(RSP) locus initiates events that lead to sperm dysfunction",
