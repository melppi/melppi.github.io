PKC also serves as the receptor for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters (By similarity). Acts in a hh-signaling pathway which regulates the Duox-dependent gut immune response to bacterial uracil; required for the activation of Cad99C and consequently Cad99C-dependent endosome formation, which is essential for the Duox-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to intestinal bacterial infection",
