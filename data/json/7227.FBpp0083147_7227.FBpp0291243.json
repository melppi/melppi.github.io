    "annotationA": "Zinc finger protein squeeze; Transcription factor involved in neuronal fate specification. First required in embryonic CNS development to define the number of cells that express apterous (ap) in the ap thoracic cluster of interneurons. Later on, it plays a central role in the combinatorial code of transcription factors that specifies the fate of the Tv neuron in the ap cluster by participating in the transcription regulation of FMRFa in Tv cells. Also required for projection neuron dendritic targeting",
    "annotationB": "NGFI-A-binding protein homolog; Transcriptional regulator that can both act as a coactivator or a corepressor depending on the context. Lacks DNA- binding domains and acts by associating with other transcription factors such as rotund (rn) and squeeze (sqz). Acts as a coactivator of sqz and is required to limit the number of neurons that express the LIM-homeodomain gene apterous and to specify Tv neuronal fate. Acts as corepressor of rn in wing development and is required to limit the expression of wingless (wg) in the wing hinge, where wg plays a mitogenic role; Belongs to the NAB family",
