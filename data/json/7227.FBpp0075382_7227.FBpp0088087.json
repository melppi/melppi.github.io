Scaffolds multiple kinases and ci into proximity to promote its hyperphosphorylation, which then targets it for SCFSlimb/proteasome-mediated processing to generate its repressor form. Hh signaling inhibits ci phosphorylation by interfering with the cos-ci-kinases complex formation. Negatively regulates hh- signaling pathways during various processes, including photoreceptor differentiation. May negatively regulate a hh-signaling pathway whic [...] ",
