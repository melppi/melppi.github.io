It functions as a co-receptor together with ligand-specific IRs (in a probable heterotetrameric complex) to detect diverse organic acids; Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10.1) family",
    "annotationB": "Odorant receptor coreceptor; Odorant coreceptor which complexes with conventional odorant receptors (ORs) to form odorant-sensing units, providing sensitive and prolonged odorant signaling and calcium permeability. Orco is a universal and integral part of the functional odorant receptor, involved in the dendritic localization of other olfactory receptors. Expression of Orco alone leads to formation of rapid and transient ion channels not directly responding to odorants, but directly activated by intracellular cAMP or cGMP. Snmp, Or67d and lush act in concert to capture fatty-acid-deriv [...] ",
