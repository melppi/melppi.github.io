    "annotationA": "GATOR complex protein NPRL2; Nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (Nprl2) is a component of the highly conserved GAP Activity Towards Rags 1 (GATOR1) complex, which inhibits Tor activity in response to amino acid starvation. Nprl2, as well as the other GATOR1 components Nprl3 and Iml1, regulates early meiotic progression; Belongs to the NPR2 family",
    "annotationB": "Protein SEC13 homolog; Functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the COPII coat (By similarity). At the endoplasmic reticulum, SEC13 is involved in the biogenesis of COPII-coated vesicles (By similarity). Recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin at the time of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Required for proper expression of ecdysone-responsive genes such as Eip74EF and Eip75B during larval development. Required for reactivation of transcription after heat shock. Required for nuclear import of phosphorylated Mad via importin msk. Has no role i [...] ",
