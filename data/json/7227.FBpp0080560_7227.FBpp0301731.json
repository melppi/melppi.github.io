The lateral or ventral identity of a cell depends upon the concentration of this protein in its nucleus during the blastoderm stage. A morphogenetic protein that specifically binds to the kappa B-related consensus sequence 5'-GRGAAAANCC-3', located in the enhancer region of zygotic genes such as Zen, Twist, Snail and Decapentaplegic. Mediates an immune response in larvae. Part of a signaling pathway involving NF-kappa-B and Toll-related receptors, that functions in the apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition.  [...] ",
