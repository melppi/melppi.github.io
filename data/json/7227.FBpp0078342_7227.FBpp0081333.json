Activates the protein kinase activity of TORC1, and thereby plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Stimulates the phosphorylation of S6K through activation of TORC1 signaling. May also have a role in activating TORC2 signaling",
    "annotationB": "Autophagy-related protein 13 homolog; Autophagy factor required for autophagosome formation. Target of the TOR kinase signaling pathway that regulates autophagy through the control of the phosphorylation status of Atg13 and Atg1. The Atg1-Atg13 complex functions at multiple levels to mediate and adjust nutrient-dependent autophagic signaling. Involved in the autophagic degradation of dBruce which controls DNA fragmentation in nurse cells",
