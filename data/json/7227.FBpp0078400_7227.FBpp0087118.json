    "annotationB": "Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmF (SmF) is an RNA binding protein that functions as part of a heteroheptameric ring structure called the Sm core. This complex binds to spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (e.g. U1, U2, U4 and U5) and helps to carry out pre-mRNA splicing. SmF also forms a heterotrimeric sub-complex with SmE and SNRPG",
