    "annotationA": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by initiating polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, leading to the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
    "annotationB": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-A; Cyclin A (CycA) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",
