It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "ATP binding; ubiquitin activating enzyme activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: cell proliferation; neuron remodeling; regulation of programmed cell death; regulation of Ras protein signal transduction; regulation of growth; autophagy; mushroom body development; larval midgut cell programmed cell death; protein ubiquitination; lipid storage; Belongs to the ubiquitin-activating E1 family",
