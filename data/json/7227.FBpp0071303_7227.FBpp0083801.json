    "annotationA": "Protein LST8 homolog; Subunit of TORC1 and TORC2, which regulate cell growth and survival in response to nutrient and hormonal signals. Essential for TORC2-mediated regulation of cell growth and phosphorylation of Akt1. However it is not required for TORC1-mediated functions such as TORC1-dependent regulation of cell growth, autophagy and phosphorylation of S6K; Belongs to the WD repeat LST8 family",
    "annotationB": "Protein SEC13 homolog; Functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the COPII coat (By similarity). At the endoplasmic reticulum, SEC13 is involved in the biogenesis of COPII-coated vesicles (By similarity). Recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin at the time of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Required for proper expression of ecdysone-responsive genes such as Eip74EF and Eip75B during larval development. Required for reactivation of transcription after heat shock. Required for nuclear import of phosphorylated Mad via importin msk. Has no role i [...] ",
