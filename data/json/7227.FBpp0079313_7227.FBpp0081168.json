    "annotationA": "Protein gurken; Critical for defining the anterior-posterior and dorsal- ventral axes of the egg. May signal directly to dorsal follicle cells through the receptor torpedo (top). During oogenesis this signaling pathway instructs follicle cells to follow a dorsal pathway of development rather than the default ventral pathway",
    "annotationB": "Homeotic protein bicoid; Segment polarity protein that provides positional cues for the development of head and thoracic segments. Regulates the expression of zygotic genes, possibly through its homeodomain, and inhibits the activity of other maternal gene products. May also bind RNA. Interacts with Bin1 to repress transcription of bicoid target genes in the anterior tip of the embryo; a process known as retraction",
