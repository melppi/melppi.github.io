    "annotationA": "Autophagy protein 5; Involved in autophagic vesicle formation. Conjugation with Atg12, through a ubiquitin-like conjugating system involving Atg7 as an E1-like activating enzyme and Atg10 as an E2-like conjugating enzyme, is essential for its function. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate acts as an E3-like enzyme which is required for lipidation of Atg8 and its association to the vesicle membranes (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase 59F, also known as Vacuolar protein sorting 34, is a lipid kinase that is required for formation of Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. It functions in a core protein complex that includes Atg6 and Vps15 and is involved in the control of vesicle trafficking, including autophagy, endocytosis and phagocytosis; Belongs to the PI3/PI4-kinase family",
