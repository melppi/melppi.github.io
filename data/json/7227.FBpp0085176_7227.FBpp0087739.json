    "annotationA": "Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog; Medea (Med) belongs to the highly conserved Smad family. Med can bind its siblings Mad or Smox to facilitate signal transduction for dpp or Activin ligands in the TGF-beta family. Med-complexes function as transcriptional regulators. Many developmental roles include dorsal-ventral patterning, patterning and proliferation of the wing disc and gene expression in the mushroom body of the larval brain",
    "annotationB": "Receptor protein serine/threonine kinase; Baboon (Babo) is the type I receptor for the activin-like ligands daw, Actbeta and myo. There are three isoforms of Babo that differ only in their extracellular domain likely resulting in different ligand binding specificity. Babo can form a complex with the type II receptors put or wit in the presence of an activin like ligand. This results in the transcriptional regulation of activin responsive genes",
