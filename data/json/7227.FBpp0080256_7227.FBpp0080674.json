    "annotationB": "Protein male-specific lethal-1; The Msl proteins are essential for elevating transcription of the single X chromosome in the male (X chromosome dosage compensation). Msl-1 is a pioneer protein. Mle, msl-1 and msl-3 are colocalized on the X chromosome. Each of the MSL proteins requires all the other MSLs for wild-type X-chromosome binding. In complex with msl-2, promotes ubiquitination of histone H2B",
