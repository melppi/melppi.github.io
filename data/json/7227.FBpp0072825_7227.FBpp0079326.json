    "annotationB": "Alanine--tRNA ligase, cytoplasmic; Catalyzes the attachment of alanine to tRNA(Ala) in a two-step reaction: alanine is first activated by ATP to form Ala- AMP and then transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA(Ala). Also edits incorrectly charged tRNA(Ala) via its editing domain; Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family",
