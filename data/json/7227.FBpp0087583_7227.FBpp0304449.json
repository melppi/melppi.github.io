It is involved in the biological process described with: cell proliferation; neuron remodeling; regulation of programmed cell death; regulation of Ras protein signal transduction; regulation of growth; autophagy; mushroom body development; larval midgut cell programmed cell death; protein ubiquitination; lipid storage; Belongs to the ubiquitin-activating E1 family",
    "annotationB": "Nedd8-conjugating enzyme Ubc12; Accepts the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 from the Uba3- APP-BP1 E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. Required for Cul1 and Cul3 neddylation. Negatively regulates full-length ci stability and hedgehog signaling; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. UBC12 subfamily",
