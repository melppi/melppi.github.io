    "annotationA": "Exostosin-2; Glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of heparan-sulfate and responsible for the alternating addition of beta-1-4-linked glucuronic acid (GlcA) and alpha-1-4-linked N- acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units to nascent heparan sulfate chains. Plays a central role in diffusion of morphogens hedgehog (hh), wingless (wg) and Decapentaplegic (dpp) via its role in heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) biosynthesis, HSPGs being required for movement of Hh, Dpp and wg morphogens",
    "annotationB": "Division abnormally delayed (Dally) is a core protein of heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the glypican family. It acts as a co-receptor for growth factors and morphogens, such as FGFs, dpp, wg, hh and upd1, and affects signaling and distribution of these ligands. Dally's roles include wing development and germline stem cell maintenance",
