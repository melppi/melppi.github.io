Plays a role in wingless (wg) signaling, possibly through the reception of the wg signal by target cells and subsequent redistribution of arm protein in response to that signal in embryos. This signal seems to be required to establish planar cell polarity and identity",
    "annotationB": "Proteasome subunit beta type-1; The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity; Belongs to the peptidase T1B family",
