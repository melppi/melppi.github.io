    "annotationA": "ATP-dependent RNA helicase bel; ATP-dependent RNA helicase that is essential and required for cellular function, larval growth, and for male and female fertility. Also required for RNA interference (RNAi), double-stranded RNA induces potent and specific gene silencing, by acting downstream of dsRNA internalization. RNAi is mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a sequence-specific, multicomponent nuclease that destroys or silences messenger RNAs homologous to the silencing trigger; Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX3/DED1 subfamily",
