    "annotationA": "DNA repair endonuclease XPF; Implicated in recombination events during meiosis, mostly in meiotic exchange. May directly resolve Holliday junctions within recombination intermediates leading to DNA exchange. Also required for the repair of mismatches within meiotic heteroduplex DNA and for nucleotide excision repair",
    "annotationB": "Structure-specific endonuclease subunit SLX1 homolog; Catalytic subunit of a heterodimeric structure-specific endonuclease that resolves DNA secondary structures generated during DNA repair and recombination. Has endonuclease activity towards branched DNA substrates, introducing single-strand cuts in duplex DNA close to junctions with ss-DNA; Belongs to the SLX1 family",
