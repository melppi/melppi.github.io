Has an important function at the level of mRNA turnover, probably acting downstream of decapping. Involved in actin dynamics and cell cycle progression, mRNA decay and probably in a pathway involved in stress response and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Functions as a regulator of apoptosis; Belongs to the eIF-5A family",
