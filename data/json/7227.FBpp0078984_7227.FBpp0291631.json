    "annotationA": "Small ubiquitin-related modifier; Smt3 is the only Drosophila SUMO family protein. It is required for embryonic patterning and mitosis. It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Ecdysone receptor (EcR) interacts with usp to form the nuclear ecdysone receptor heterodimer, which modulates, in conjunction with co-activators and co-repressors, the activities of hundreds of genes in a tissue- and stage-specific way. EcR is widely expressed in embryonic and larval tissues and in some adult tissues where its activities (modulated by the hormone ecdysone) trigger both molting and metamorphosis",
