    "annotationA": "Protein Wnt-4; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Acts downstream of homeotic complex genes in the visceral mesoderm and is required for embryonic segmentation. Also required for cell movement and FAK regulation during ovarian morphogenesis",
    "annotationB": "Armadillo segment polarity protein; Isoform neural may associate with CadN and participate in the transmission of developmental information. Can associate with alpha-catenin. Isoform cytoplasmic accumulates through wg signaling; arm function in wg signal transduction is required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Arm and Abl proteins function cooperatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and epidermis; Belongs to the beta-catenin family",
