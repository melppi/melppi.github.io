    "annotationB": "NADPH-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1; Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly (CIA) machinery. Required for the maturation of extramitochondrial Fe-S proteins. Part of an electron transfer chain functioning in an early step of cytosolic Fe-S biogenesis. Transfers electrons from NADPH to the Fe-S cluster of the anamorsin/DRE2 homolog; Belongs to the NADPH-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase NDOR1 family",
