    "annotationA": "Homeotic protein bicoid; Segment polarity protein that provides positional cues for the development of head and thoracic segments. Regulates the expression of zygotic genes, possibly through its homeodomain, and inhibits the activity of other maternal gene products. May also bind RNA. Interacts with Bin1 to repress transcription of bicoid target genes in the anterior tip of the embryo; a process known as retraction",
    "annotationB": "EIF4E-Homologous Protein (4EHP) binds the 7-methyl-guanosine cap structure of mRNA and functions as a negative regulator of translation. 4EHP contributes to embryonic patterning by negatively regulating translation of cad and hb, and is also implicated in regulating ecdysone biosynthesis; Belongs to the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E family",
