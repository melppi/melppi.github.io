    "annotationA": "Exportin-1; Receptor for the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). Binds cooperatively to the NES on its target protein and to the small GTPase Ran in its active GTP-bound form. Required for the function or maintenance of certain tissues such as brain and gut. Involved in the export of dl from the nucleus to the cytoplasm; Belongs to the exportin family",
    "annotationB": "14-3-3 protein zeta; Required in Raf-dependent cell proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation during eye development. Acts upstream of Raf and downstream of Ras, and is essential for viability. Acts as a negative regulator of the slo calcium channel via its interaction with slo- binding protein slob. Inhibits yki activity by restricting its nuclear localization. Binds to and promotes the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase Pi3K68D which converts phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol-3- phosphate and promotes maturation of early endosomes",
