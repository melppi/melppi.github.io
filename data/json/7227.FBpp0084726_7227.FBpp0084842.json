Mediates the snRNAs 3' cleavage (By similarity). Involved in the 3'-end processing of the U7 snRNA, and also the spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4 and U5. May mediate recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein to the nuclear envelope, probably as component of the INT complex (By similarity); Belongs to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. RNA-metabolizing metallo-beta-lactamase-like family. INTS [...] ",
