    "annotationA": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7; Component of a protein kinase signal transduction cascade. Mediator of TGF-beta signal transduction. Responsible for activation of the JNK MAPK pathway (basket, bsk and hemipterous, hep) in response to LPS. Component of the NF-kappa-B pathway; relish-mediated JNK inhibition involves proteasomal degradation of Tak1; certain targets of Relish that are induced during immune responses may facilitate destruction of Tak1 and switch off the JNK cascade. Participates in diverse roles such as control of cell shape and regulation of apoptosis",

Required for JNK-dependent non-autonomous apoptosis through release from apoptotic cells and activation of apoptosis in neighboring cells. Required for JNK-independent damage-induced apoptosis in the embryonic central nervous system through regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene hid. Involved in the innate immune response to extracellular pathogens. Plays a role in the melanization immune response through its involvement in the rupture of crystal cells an [...] ",
