Necessary for the final stages of tracheal maturation, to facilitate the transition from water-filled to gas-filled tubes. May help to maintain the integrity of the outer hydrophobic envelope of the trachea",

May act as a fidelity factor of the translation reaction, by catalyzing a one- codon backward translocation of tRNAs on improperly translocated ribosomes. Binds to mitochondrial ribosomes in a GTP-dependent manner",
