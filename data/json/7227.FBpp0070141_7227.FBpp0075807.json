    "annotationA": "Retinoblastoma-family protein (Rbf) binds to members of the E2F transcription factors and forms the DREAM complex, which regulates genes with diverse biological functions including cell cycle regulators, apoptosis regulators, and DNA replication/repair factors. Rbf can also bind chromosomal proteins and modulate genome stability. Rbf is negatively regulated by CycE-Cdk2 and CycD-Cdk4 cyclin-dependent kinase complexes",
    "annotationB": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-A; Cyclin A (CycA) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",
