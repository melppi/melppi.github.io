Regulates localization of the augmin complex during mitosis by ensuring its location on mitotic spindles. Also regulates augmin complex localization during male meiosis by promoting its placement at kinetochores while preventing its association with spindle microtubules",
    "annotationB": "RE72064p; Mad2 is a conserved component of the spindle checkpoint. During mitosis, it is recruited to unattached kinetochores, where it binds Mad1 and fzy, promoting the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex. During interphase, Mad2 is intranuclear, bound to Mad1, and associated primarily with the nuclear pore complex",
