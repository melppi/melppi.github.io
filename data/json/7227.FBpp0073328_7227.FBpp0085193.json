Switches between a cytoplasmic GDP- and a nuclear GTP-bound state by nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Nuclear import receptors such as importin beta bind their substrates only in the absence of GTP-bound Ran and release them upon direct interaction with GTP-bound Ran while export receptors behave in the opposite way. Thereby, RAN controls cargo loading and release by transport receptors in the proper compartment a [...] ",
