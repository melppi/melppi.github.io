    "annotationA": "Inactive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase shutdown; Co-chaperone required during oogenesis to repress transposable elements and prevent their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity. Acts via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and govern the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons. Acts as a co-chaperone via its interaction with Hsp83/HSP90 and is required for the biogenesis of all three piRNA major populations",
    "annotationB": "Protein vreteno; Gonad-specific protein essential for germline development to repress transposable elements and preventing their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity. Acts via the piRNA metabolic process in both germline and somatic gonadal tissues by mediating the repression of transposable elements during meiosis. Required for primary piRNA biogenesis in both germline and somatic gonadal tissues",
