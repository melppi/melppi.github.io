Common component of RNA polymerases I, II and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors, mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs, and small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Pols are composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. In Pol II, RPB6 is part of the clamp e [...] ",

This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Pseudouridine (\"psi\") residues may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs (By similarity)",
