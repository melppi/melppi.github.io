Second largest core component of RNA polymerase III which synthesizes small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol III is composed of mobile elements and RPC2 is part of the core element with the central large cleft and probably a clamp element that moves to open and close the clef [...] ",
