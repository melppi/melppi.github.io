This receptor binds to the consensus sequence [AG][AG]AAGTCAA. Plays a key role in the establishment of non-metameric domains at the anterior and posterior poles of the embryo. It may also play a role in the nervous system. The maternal terminal pathway activates the tll gene in the termini; TLL activity then represses segmentation and acti [...] ",
