Inhibits spontaneous melanization and appears to be involved in the melanization immune response to physical wounding in larvae and adults. Acts by negatively regulating the Hayan-phenoloxidase (PPO1) cascade in the hemolymph and possibly the trachea. May function by controlling the initial release of the activated form of PPO1, phenoloxidase (PO) and thus maintains PO availability for processes such as wound response and p [...] ",
