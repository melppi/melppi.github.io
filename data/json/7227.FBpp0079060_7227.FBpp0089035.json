    "annotationA": "Protein wingless; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Segment polarity protein. May be a growth factor. Acts on neighboring cells to regulate at least one gene, the homeobox segmentation gene engrailed. Wg signal represses arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of engrailed autoactivation. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation. Wg also acts in the developing epidermis. Acts as a morphogen, [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Armadillo segment polarity protein; Isoform neural may associate with CadN and participate in the transmission of developmental information. Can associate with alpha-catenin. Isoform cytoplasmic accumulates through wg signaling; arm function in wg signal transduction is required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Arm and Abl proteins function cooperatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and epidermis; Belongs to the beta-catenin family",
