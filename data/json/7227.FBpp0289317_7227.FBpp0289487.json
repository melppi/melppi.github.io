Grn contributes to multiple other developmental processes including leg and larval spiracle morphogenesis",
    "annotationB": "Fork head is a winged-helix nuclear transcription factor most studied for its role in salivary gland formation, where it is required for salivary gland viability, invagination, and maintaining expression of other early-expressed salivary gland transcription factors. It works with sage to activate expression of salivary gland specific gene products, such as secreted proteins and their modifying enzymes",
