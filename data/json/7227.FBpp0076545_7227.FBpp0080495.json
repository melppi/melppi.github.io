    "annotationB": "V-type proton ATPase subunit H; Subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar ATPase. Subunit H activates the ATPase activity of the enzyme and couples ATPase activity to proton flow. Vacuolar ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, thus providing most of the energy required for transport processes in the vacuolar system (By similarity)",
