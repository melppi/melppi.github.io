Target of the TOR kinase signaling pathway that regulates autophagy through the control of the phosphorylation status of Atg13 and Atg1. The Atg1-Atg13 complex functions at multiple levels to mediate and adjust nutrient-dependent autophagic signaling. Involved in the autophagic degradation of dBruce which controls DNA fragmentation in nurse cells",
