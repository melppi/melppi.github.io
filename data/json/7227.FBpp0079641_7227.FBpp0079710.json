    "annotationA": "Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) is a catalytic protein kinase subunit that can only become active after association with either CycA, CycB or CycB3. The protein kinase activities of these complexes (CycA-Cdk1, CycB-Cdk1, CycB3-Cdk1) control important aspects of progression through the cell cycle. Functionally, the different Cdk1 complexes are partially redundant. They phosphorylate hundreds of target proteins and are most important for progression into and through mitotic and meiotic M phases; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CMGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family. CDC2/CDKX subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore complex protein Nup107; Plays a role in nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly and maintenance. Required for nuclear import of Mad. Plays a role in double strand break repair by relocalizing the heterochromatic double strain breaks (DSBs) to the nuclear periphery as part of the homologous recombination (HR) repair process. Regulates cytokinesis during spermatocyte meiosis by maintaining type-B lamin Lam localization to the spindle envelope. Regulates female gonad development and oogenesis; Belongs to the nucleoporin Nup84/Nup107 family",
