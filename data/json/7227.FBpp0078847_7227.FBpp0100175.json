It is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport complex I, which is part of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. It may have a role in regulating aggression behavior",

Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone (By similarity)",
