Can phosphorylate a large number of proteins. Negative regulator of wg signaling. Phosphorylates arm directly or indirectly and stimulates its degradation which prevents inappropriate wg signaling. Phosphorylates smo which promotes its accumulation at the cell surface and its signaling activity in response to hh. Together with dco, regulates proteolytic processing of ci by phosphorylating it which promotes its binding to slmb, the F [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Frizzled; Receptor for Wnt proteins. Most of frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK- 3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase. Both pathways seem to in [...] ",
