    "annotationA": "Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein 1; Isoform Mocs1a and isoform Mocs1b probably form a complex that catalyzes the conversion of 5'-GTP to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Mocs1a catalyzes the cyclization of GTP to (8S)-3',8-cyclo-7,8-dihydroguanosine 5'- triphosphate and Mocs1b catalyzes the subsequent conversion of (8S)-3',8-cyclo-7,8-dihydroguanosine 5'-triphosphate to cPMP; In the C-terminal section; belongs to the MoaC family",
    "annotationB": "Adenylyltransferase and sulfurtransferase MOCS3; Plays a central role in 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of cytosolic tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Also essential during biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Acts by mediating the C-terminal thiocarboxylation of sulfur carriers URM1 and MOCS2A. Its N-terminus first activates URM1 and MOCS2A as acyl-adenylates (-COAMP), then the persulfide sulfur on the catalytic cysteine is transferred to URM1 and MOCS2A to form thiocarboxylation (-COSH) of their C-terminus. The reaction probably involves hydrogen sulfide t [...] ",
