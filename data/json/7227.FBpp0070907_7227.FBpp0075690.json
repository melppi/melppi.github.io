It shows synergistic genetic interaction with the essential APC/C subunit, Cdc23. Apc7-APC/C association may be either transient or occurs only in certain forms of the APC/C complex",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by initiating polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, leading to the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
