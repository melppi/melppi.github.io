At the endoplasmic reticulum, SEC13 is involved in the biogenesis of COPII-coated vesicles (By similarity). Recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin at the time of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Required for proper expression of ecdysone-responsive genes such as Eip74EF and Eip75B during larval development. Required for reactivation of transcription after heat shock. Required for nuclear import of phosphorylated Mad via importin msk. Has no role i [...] ",

Coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. Required for limiting lipid storage in lipid droplets. Involved in the expansion of luminal extracellular matrices and apical membrane during tubulogenesis. Required [...] ",
