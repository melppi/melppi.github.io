Required for synthesis and/or stability of oskar protein (osk) and localization of tudor (tud) in both the nuage and posterior pole of the oocyte. Required for normal posterior localization of osk in later stages of oogenesis and for posterior localization of the vasa (vas) protein during the entire process of pole plasm assembly. May act by regulating the complex that contains the arginine N- methyltransferase csul",
