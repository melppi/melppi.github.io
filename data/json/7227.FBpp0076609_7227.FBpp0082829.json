Transcriptional regulator involved in the activation of a large number of genes in the visceral mesoderm including betaTub60D, dpp and Hand. Binds to and regulates a number of enhancers driving expression in the visceral mesoderm in a temporally and spatially restricted manner. Also to binds to enhancers cooperatively with activators, such as bap or HLH54F, to coregulate expression of shared target genes in the visceral mesoderm. Binds to the Ndg enhancer a [...] ",

Required for segmental identity of the second through eighth abdominal segments. Once a pattern of abd-A expression is turned on in a given parasegment, it remains on the more posterior parasegment, so that the complex pattern of expression is built up in the successive parasegments. Appears to repress expression of Ubx whenever they appear in the same cell, but abd-A is repressed  [...] ",
