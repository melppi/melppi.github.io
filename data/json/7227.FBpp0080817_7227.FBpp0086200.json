    "annotationA": "Probable dolichol-phosphate mannosyltransferase; Transfers mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol monophosphate to form dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) which is the mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane anchoring, and O- mannosylation of proteins; Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family",
    "annotationB": "GPI mannosyltransferase 2; Mannosyltransferase involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis. Transfers the second mannose to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol during GPI precursor assembly. Required for the GPI-mediated endoplasmic reticulum exit and proper targeting to the cell surface of chp. Required for GPI-mediated membrane attachment of chp, qsm and Cont. Essential for microvillar stability in the rhabdomere; Belongs to the PIGV family",
