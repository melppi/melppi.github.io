The preRC is present at all chromosomal origins of replication and is required for the initiation of DNA replication. Cdc6 also functions in the co-ordination of DNA replication with mitosis, and may contribute to apoptosis and transcription",

In the complex, RPN6 is required for proteasome assembly (By similarity). May act as linker between 19S regulatory subunit and the 20S proteasome core",
