Introduces a single-strand break via transesterification at a target site in duplex DNA (By similarity). The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 5'-OH DNA strand (By similarity). The free DNA strand then undergoes passage around the unb [...] ",
