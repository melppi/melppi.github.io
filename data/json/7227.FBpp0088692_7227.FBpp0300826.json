Required during gastrulation and appears to regulate early embryonic signaling pathways. Inhibits tyrosine kinase receptor signaling by promoting degradation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated, active receptor, potentially by sorting activated receptors into MVBs. The MVBs are then trafficked to the lysosome where their contents are degraded",
    "annotationB": "Vacuolar protein sorting 20 (Vps20) is a member of the ESCRT-III complex, which sorts certain endocytosed receptors for degradation via the multivesicular body. As part of this complex, Vps20 is also involved in abscission following cytokinesis; Belongs to the SNF7 family",
