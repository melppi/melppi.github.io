    "annotationA": "Diptericin A is an immune inducible antibacterial peptide with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. It is expressed in the fat body during the systemic immune response and in various epithelia. Its expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the Immune Deficiency pathway; Belongs to the attacin/sarcotoxin-2 family",

Rel-p68 subunit translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the promoter of the Cecropin A1 gene and probably other antimicrobial peptide genes. I-kappa-B kinase complex (ird5 and key) and PGRP-LC are essential signaling components in transmitting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal leading to cact degradation for NF-kappa-B (rel) activation. Part of a Toll-related receptor pathway that functions in the apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition. May be part of a NF- kappa-B and Tollo signa [...] ",
