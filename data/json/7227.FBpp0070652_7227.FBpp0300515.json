The CBC complex is involved in miRNA-mediated RNA interference via its interaction with Ars2 and is required for primary microRNAs (miRNAs) processing. Also involved in innate immunity via the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processing machinery by restricting the viral RNA production. In the CBC complex, Cbp80 does not bind directly capped RNAs [...] ",
