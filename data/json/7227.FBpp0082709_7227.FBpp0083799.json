Critical for ovulation, meiotic progression in oocytes and female courtship behavior, including their postmating changes. Regulates female meiosis by controlling calcineurin activity in the germline. Has a role in calcium signaling during egg activation; bcd mRNA polyadenylation and translation in the oocyte; Belongs to the RCAN family",
