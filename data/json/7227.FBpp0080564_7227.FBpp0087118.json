    "annotationA": "DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB11; DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB11 is part of the core element with the central large cleft (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmF (SmF) is an RNA binding protein that functions as part of a heteroheptameric ring structure called the Sm core. This complex binds to spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (e.g. U1, U2, U4 and U5) and helps to carry out pre-mRNA splicing. SmF also forms a heterotrimeric sub-complex with SmE and SNRPG",
