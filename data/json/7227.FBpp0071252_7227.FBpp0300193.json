    "annotationA": "Synembryn; Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which can activate some, but not all, G-alpha proteins independently of G- protein coupled receptors. Acts by exchanging bound GDP for free GTP. Plays a key role in asymmetric spindle positioning, a step for asymmetric cell division that generates cell diversity during development by activating G(i) alpha protein independently of G- protein coupled receptors. In addition to its GEF activity, it plays an essential role in cortical subcellular localization of heterotrimeric G proteins, suggesting it acts as a facilitator of G-alpha fun [...] ",
