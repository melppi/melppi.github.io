    "annotationA": "Protein Wnt-2; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Segment polarity protein. May function in gonadogenesis and limb development. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation",
    "annotationB": "Armadillo segment polarity protein; Isoform neural may associate with CadN and participate in the transmission of developmental information. Can associate with alpha-catenin. Isoform cytoplasmic accumulates through wg signaling; arm function in wg signal transduction is required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Arm and Abl proteins function cooperatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and epidermis; Belongs to the beta-catenin family",
