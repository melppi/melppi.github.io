Upregulation of Dap is required after the last mitosis for arresting cells in G1/G0 before terminal differentiation in many post-mitotic cell types",

Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by specifically elongating polyubiquitin chains initiated by the E2 enzyme vih/UbcH10 on APC/C substrates, enhancing the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit",
