    "annotationB": "Neutral ceramidase; Hydrolyzes the sphingolipid ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid at an optimal pH of 6.5-7.5. Acts as a key regulator of sphingolipid signaling metabolites by generating sphingosine at the cell surface. Regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and trafficking by controlling presynaptic terminal sphingolipid composition; Belongs to the neutral ceramidase family",
