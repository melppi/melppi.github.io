    "annotationA": "Ras-like protein 1; Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). Plays a role in eye development by regulating cell growth, survival of postmitotic ommatidial cells and differentiation of photoreceptor cells. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, a hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis",
    "annotationB": "Discs overgrown protein kinase; Involved in circadian rhythms, viability and molecular oscillations of the clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim). Dbt reduces the stability and thus the accumulation of monomeric per proteins, probably through phosphorylation. No evident circadian oscillation is detected in head. Together with CkIalpha, regulates processing of ci by phosphorylating it which promotes its binding to slmb, the F-box recognition component of the SCF(slmb) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.
