Promotes or induces cell death either by direct binding to and inhibition of BIRC proteins (also called inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs), leading to an increase in caspase activity, or by a BIRC inhibition-independent, caspase-independent and serine protease activity-dependent mechanism. Can antagonize antiapoptotic activity of th by directly inducing the degradation of th",
    "annotationB": "Death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1; Anti-apoptotic protein which functions as a caspase regulator, using its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity to smother caspase activity. Binds, ubiquitinates and inactivates initiator caspase Dronc, and effector caspases Drice and Dcp-1. Acts as a Nedd8-E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase for Drice. Suppresses apoptosis by targeting the apoptosome for ubiquitination and inactivation. Plays an important role in cell motility. Overexpression suppresses rpr and hid-dependent cell death in the eye. Interaction of Diap1 with Dronc is required to suppress [...] ",
