Involved in both positive regulation (at the posterior terminus) and negative regulation (at the anterior domain) of tll, as in other terminal class gene products, maybe via the ERK-A kinase",
    "annotationB": "Protein smoothened; Segment polarity protein required for correct patterning of every segment. G protein-coupled receptor that associates with the patched protein (ptc) to transduce the hedgehog (hh) signal through the activation of an inhibitory G-protein. In the absence of hh, ptc represses the constitutive signaling activity of smo through fused (fu). Essential component of a hh-signaling pathway which regulates the Duox-dependent gut immune response to bacterial uracil; required to activate Cad99C-dependent endosome formation, norpA-dependent Ca2+ mobilization and p38 MAPK, which a [...] ",
