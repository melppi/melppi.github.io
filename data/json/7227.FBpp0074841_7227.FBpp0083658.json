The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF. The CSN complex plays an essential role in oogenesis and embryogenesis and is required for proper photoreceptor R cell differentiation and promote lamina glial cell migration or axon targeting.
