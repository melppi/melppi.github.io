    "annotationA": "Replication protein A 70 kDa DNA-binding subunit; As part of the heterotrimeric replication protein A complex (RPA/RP-A), binds and stabilizes single-stranded DNA intermediates, that form during DNA replication or upon DNA stress. It prevents their reannealing and in parallel, recruits and activates different proteins and complexes involved in DNA metabolism. Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage",

Involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA double strand break repair (By similarity). Sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that has a high affinity for a 31 bp sequence in the Yp1 gene. Site-specific DNA binding to 31 bp P element inverted repeats",
