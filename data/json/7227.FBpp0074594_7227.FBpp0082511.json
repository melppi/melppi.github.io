    "annotationA": "Possible lysine-specific histone demethylase 1; Probable histone demethylase that specifically demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation, thereby acting as a corepressor. Required for heterochromatic gene silencing. Acts by oxidizing the substrate by FAD to generate the corresponding imine that is subsequently hydrolyzed. Demethylates both mono- and tri- methylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3. May also demethylate 'Lys-9' of histone H3, Plays a role in the repression of neuronal genes; Belongs to the flavin monoamine oxidase family",
    "annotationB": "Probable histone-binding protein Caf1; Core histone-binding subunit that may target chromatin assembly factors, chromatin remodeling factors and histone deacetylases to their histone substrates in a manner that is regulated by nucleosomal DNA. Component of several complexes which regulate chromatin metabolism. These include the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, which is required for chromatin assembly following DNA replication and DNA repair; the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (the NuRD complex), which promotes transcriptional repression by histone deacetylati [...] ",
