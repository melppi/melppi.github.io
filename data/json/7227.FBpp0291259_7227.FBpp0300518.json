    "annotationB": "Aldehyde dehydrogenase type III (Aldh-III) confers a xenobiotic stress resistance by oxidising aromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde). It also neutralises the lipid aldehydes formed after the attack of reactive oxygen and radicals, such as malondialdehyde during lipid peroxidation. The catalytic redox reaction uses NAD(P)+ as a cofactor",
