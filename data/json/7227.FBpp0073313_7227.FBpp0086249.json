Required maternally for the establishment of the normal array of embryonic segments: involved in the control of pair-rule gene transcription in a stripe-specific manner. Together with Hsp83 and piwi, mediates canalization, also known as developmental robustness, likely via epigenetic silencing of existing genetic variants and suppression of transposon-induced new genetic variation",
