Dolichols are required for the synthesis of dolichol-linked monosaccharides and the oligosaccharide precursor used for N-glycosylation. Acts as a polyprenol reductase that promotes the reduction of the alpha-isoprene unit of polyprenols into dolichols in a NADP-dependent mechanism (By similarity)",
