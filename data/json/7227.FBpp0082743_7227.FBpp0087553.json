    "annotationA": "COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5; Probable protease subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has no metalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunits of  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "RE12958p; Dacapo (Dap) is a Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in the CIP/KIP family. It binds to CycE-Cdk2 complexes and thereby inhibits their protein kinase activity. Upregulation of Dap is required after the last mitosis for arresting cells in G1/G0 before terminal differentiation in many post-mitotic cell types",
