The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation",

The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation. In the eIF-3 complex, eif3d specifically recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine cap of a subset of mRNAs",
