Possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity when in complex with Elongin BC complex, Cul2 and Rox1a/Rbx1, and can target sima/Hif1a for ubiquitination. May play a critical role in promoting microtubule stabilization when tubulins are correctly folded by the prefoldin complex. If tubulin is incorrectly folded, may promote its degradation",
