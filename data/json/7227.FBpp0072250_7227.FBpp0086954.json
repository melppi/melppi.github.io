    "annotationA": "Inorganic pyrophosphatase; Component of NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor), a complex which catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding and facilitates transcription of chromatin. NURF is required for homeotic gene expression, proper larval blood cell development, normal male X chromosome morphology, ecdysteroid signaling and metamorphosis. Nurf-38 may have adapted to deliver pyrophosphatase to chromatin to assist in replication or transcription by efficient removal of the inhibitory metabolite; Belongs to the PPase family",

NURF catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding and facilitates transcription of chromatin. It is required for homeotic gene expression, proper larval blood cell development, normal male X chromosome morphology, ecdysteroid signaling and metamorphosis",
