    "annotationA": "N-glycosylase/DNA lyase; DNA repair enzyme that incises DNA at 8-oxoG residues. Excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N- methylformamidopyrimidine (FAPY) from damaged DNA. Has a beta- lyase activity that nicks DNA 3' to the lesion. Efficiently incises DNA duplexes containing 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua), 8- hydroxyadenine (8-OH-Ade) and abasic (AP) sites placed opposite to a cytosine",
    "annotationB": "Endonuclease III homolog; Bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase with associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase function that catalyzes the first step in base excision repair (BER), the primary repair pathway for the repair of oxidative DNA damage. The DNA N-glycosylase activity releases the damaged DNA base from DNA by cleaving the N- glycosidic bond, leaving an AP site. The AP lyase activity cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3' to the AP site by a beta-elimination. Primarily recognizes and repairs oxidative base damage of pyrimidines; Belongs to the Nth/MutY family",
