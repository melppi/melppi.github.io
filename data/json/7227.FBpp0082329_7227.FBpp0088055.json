DNA-binding is ATP-dependent, however specific DNA sequences that define origins of replication have not been identified so far. ORC is required to assemble the pre-replication complex necessary to initiate DNA replication",
    "annotationB": "DNA replication licensing factor MCM4; Acts as component of the Mcm2-7 complex (Mcm complex) which is the putative replicative helicase essential for 'once per cell cycle' DNA replication initiation and elongation in eukaryotic cells. The active ATPase sites in the Mcm2-7 ring are formed through the interaction surfaces of two neighboring subunits such that a critical structure of a conserved arginine finger motif is provided in trans relative to the ATP-binding site of the Walker A box of the adjacent subunit. The six ATPase active sites, however, are likely to contribute differential [...] ",
