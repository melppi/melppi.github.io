Required for arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of en autoactivation. Negatively controls the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) growth in presynaptic motoneurons. Plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and actin cytoskeleton during embryogenesis. Required for phosphorylation of sra in activated eggs. Essential for completion of meiosis, possibly by triggering c [...] ",
