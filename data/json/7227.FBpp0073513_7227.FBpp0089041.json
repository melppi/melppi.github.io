Can phosphorylate a large number of proteins. Negative regulator of wg signaling. Phosphorylates arm directly or indirectly and stimulates its degradation which prevents inappropriate wg signaling. Phosphorylates smo which promotes its accumulation at the cell surface and its signaling activity in response to hh.
