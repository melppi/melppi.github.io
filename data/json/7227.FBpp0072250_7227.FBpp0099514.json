    "annotationA": "Inorganic pyrophosphatase; Component of NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor), a complex which catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding and facilitates transcription of chromatin. NURF is required for homeotic gene expression, proper larval blood cell development, normal male X chromosome morphology, ecdysteroid signaling and metamorphosis. Nurf-38 may have adapted to deliver pyrophosphatase to chromatin to assist in replication or transcription by efficient removal of the inhibitory metabolite; Belongs to the PPase family",
    "annotationB": "C-terminal-binding protein; Corepressor targeting diverse transcription regulators. Hairy-interacting protein required for embryonic segmentation and hairy-mediated transcriptional repression; Belongs to the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family",
