Transfers glucose from dolichyl phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol (By similarity). Functions in developmental processes such as germband extension, the apical constriction of mesoderm precursor cells and ventral furrow formation in early embryogenesis prior to gastrulation. Involved in the glycosylation and intracellular distribution of shg ( [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase; Required for normal production of N-glycosylated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Required for embryonic segmentation, dorsal-ventral patterning and gastrulation. Required for chitin orientation and shaping of the apical and lateral plasma membranes of epidermal cells during cuticle differentiation. Also required for correctly shaping apical membrane topology of the epithelia of other organs such as the midgut and the hindgut",
