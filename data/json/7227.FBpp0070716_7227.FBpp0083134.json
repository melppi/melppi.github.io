This interaction is required for the subsequent binding of U2 snRNP and the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP (By similarity). Plays a role in regulating sex-lethal splicing; Belongs to the RRM U1 A/B'' family",
    "annotationB": "U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C; Component of the spliceosomal U1 snRNP, which is essential for recognition of the pre-mRNA 5' splice-site and the subsequent assembly of the spliceosome. U1-C is directly involved in initial 5' splice-site recognition for both constitutive and regulated alternative splicing. The interaction with the 5' splice-site seems to precede base-pairing between the pre-mRNA and the U1 snRNA. Stimulates commitment or early (E) complex formation by stabilizing the base pairing of the 5' end of the U1 snRNA and the 5' splice-site region (By similarity). Regulat [...] ",
