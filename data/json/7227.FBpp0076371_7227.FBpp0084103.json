    "annotationA": "Cell division control protein; Cdc6 is an essential component of the pre-Replication complex (preRC) together with the origin recognition complex, dup and MCM2-7 proteins. The preRC is present at all chromosomal origins of replication and is required for the initiation of DNA replication. Cdc6 also functions in the co-ordination of DNA replication with mitosis, and may contribute to apoptosis and transcription",
    "annotationB": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B3; Cyclins are positive regulatory subunits of the cyclin- dependent kinases (CDKs), and thereby play an essential role in the control of the cell cycle, notably via their destruction during cell division. Probably functions redundantly with other cyclins in regulation of cell cycle. Its presence may be required to delay a deadline for completing cytokinesis that is ordinary imposed by nuclear envelope reformation. Degradation of CycB and CycB3 promote cytokinesis furrow initiation and ingression. Required with CycB for female fertility",
