Twf is highly conserved and is present in all eukaryotes except plants. Its roles include bristle and neuronal development; Belongs to the actin-binding proteins ADF family. Twinfilin subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Profilin; Binds to actin and affects the structure of the cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of IP3 and DG. This profilin is required for intercellular cytoplasm transport during Drosophila oogenesis",
