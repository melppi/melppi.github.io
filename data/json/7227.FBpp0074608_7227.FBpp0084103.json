Regulates localization of the augmin complex during mitosis by ensuring its location on mitotic spindles. Also regulates augmin complex localization during male meiosis by promoting its placement at kinetochores while preventing its association with spindle microtubules",
    "annotationB": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B3; Cyclins are positive regulatory subunits of the cyclin- dependent kinases (CDKs), and thereby play an essential role in the control of the cell cycle, notably via their destruction during cell division. Probably functions redundantly with other cyclins in regulation of cell cycle. Its presence may be required to delay a deadline for completing cytokinesis that is ordinary imposed by nuclear envelope reformation. Degradation of CycB and CycB3 promote cytokinesis furrow initiation and ingression. Required with CycB for female fertility",
