    "annotationA": "Peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase; Monooxygenase that catalyzes an essential reaction in C- terminal alpha-amidation of peptides. Produces an unstable peptidyl(2-hydroxyglycine) intermediate. C-terminal amidation of peptides is required for normal developmental transitions and for biosynthesis of secretory peptides throughout the life; Belongs to the copper type II ascorbate-dependent monooxygenase family",
    "annotationB": "Peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase 2; Probable lyase that catalyzes an essential reaction in C-terminal alpha-amidation of peptides. Mediates the dismutation of the unstable peptidyl(2-hydroxyglycine) intermediate to glyoxylate and the corresponding desglycine peptide amide. C- terminal amidation of peptides such as neuropeptides is essential for full biological activity",
