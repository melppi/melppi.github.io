    "annotationA": "Reduction in Cnn dots 5 (Rcd5) belongs to the family of forkhead-associated domain proteins. As part of the Non-Specific Lethal complex, it regulates transcription of housekeeping genes by facilitating recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters. During mitosis it plays a key role in chromosomal-dependent microtubule assembly, centriole duplication and pericentriolar material maturation",
    "annotationB": "RuvB-like helicase 1; Acts as a transcriptional coactivator in Wg signaling caused by altered arm signaling. Pont and rept interfere antagonistically with nuclear arm signaling function, and are required to enhance or reduce arm activity, respectively. Also an essential cofactor for the normal function of Myc; required for cellular proliferation and growth",
