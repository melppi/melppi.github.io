Specifically uses GDP-fucose as donor substrate and proper disulfide pairing of the substrate EGF domains is required for fucose transfer. Plays a crucial role in Notch signaling. Initial fucosylation of Notch/N by POFUT1 generates a substrate for Fringe/Fng, an acetylglucosaminyltransferase that can [...] ",
