Second largest core component of RNA polymerase I which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol I is composed of mobile elements and RPA2 is part of the core element with the central large cleft and probably a clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft (By similarity)",
