The 26S proteasome is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The function of the 'Lys-63'-specific deubiquitination of the proteasome is unclear (By similarity)",

Required for proper telomere behavior during cell divisions and possibly for ubiquitination of proteins involved in postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. Deletion mutations are lethal in homozygotes",
