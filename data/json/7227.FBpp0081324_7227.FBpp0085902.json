Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. Involved in exon definition of genes containing long introns, including the rolled/MAPK gene. Has a role in oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the developing oocyte",
