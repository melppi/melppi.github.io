    "annotationA": "Transcriptional adaptor 3, isoform A; Histone acetyltransferase activity; chromatin binding. It is involved in the biological process described with: histone H3-K14 acetylation; chromatin remodeling; histone H3 acetylation; histone H3-K9 acetylation; histone H4-K12 acetylation; positive regulation of histone acetylation; histone H3-S10 phosphorylation; histone acetylation; histone H4 acetylation; chromatin-mediated maintenance of transcription",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase nonstop; Histone deubiquitinating component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA. Catalyzes the deubiquitination of histone H2B, thereby acting as a coactivator in a large subset of genes. Required to counteract heterochromatin silencing. Controls the development of neuronal connectivity in visual system by being required for accurate axon targeting in the optic lobe. Required for expression of ecdysone-induced genes such as br/broad; Belongs to the peptidase C19 family. UBP8 subfamily",
