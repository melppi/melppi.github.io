    "annotationA": "Henna (Hn) is a tryptophan phenylalanine hydroxylase. Hn is a dual function enzyme: it hydroxylates both phenylalanine to generate tyrosine, as well as tryptophan to generate the precursor for peripheral (non-neuronal) serotonin. Hn is also involved in pteridine synthesis",
    "annotationB": "Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase; Catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to dopamine, L-5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and L-tryptophan to tryptamine. Variation in the synthesis of bioamines may be a factor contributing to natural variation in life span; Belongs to the group II decarboxylase family",
