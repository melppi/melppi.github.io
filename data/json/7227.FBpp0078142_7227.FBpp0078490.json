    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Required for postreplication repair of UV-damaged DNA. Involved in the negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway in the wing by acting with the putative E3 ligases poe, Kcmf1 and Ufd4 to mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of rl/MAPK; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
