It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore complex protein Nup75; Component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that seems to be required for NPC assembly and maintenance (By similarity). Required for nuclear import of phosphorylated Mad via importin msk. Has no role in classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS)-dependent nuclear import via importin-beta. Facilitates the interaction between Nup93 and sec13 with msk",
