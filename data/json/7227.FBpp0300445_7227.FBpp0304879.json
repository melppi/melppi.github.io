Plays a role as a negative translational regulator of specific mRNAs. Represses translation of the microtubule-associated protein futsch mRNA to regulate microtubule-dependent synaptic growth and function. May also be involved in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational suppression. Required for stability of the central pair of microtubules in the spermatid axoneme. Regulates photoreceptor  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "60S ribosomal protein L5; Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl- transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through [...] ",
