    "annotationA": "Aurora B (AurB) is a serine-threonine kinase and member of the chromosomal passenger complex. AurB plays multiple roles in mitosis including the correction of erroneous chromosome-spindle interactions, chromosome condensation, kinetochore assembly, spindle assembly checkpoint and cytokinesis; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Aurora subfamily",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore glycoprotein p62; Essential component of the nuclear pore complex (By similarity). The N-terminal is probably involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (By similarity). The C-terminal is involved in protein-protein interaction probably via coiled-coil formation, promotes its association with centrosomes and may function in anchorage of Nup62 to the pore complex (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active genes. Negatively regulates chromatin attachment to the nuclear envelope, probably by preventing chromatin tethering by Nup154",
