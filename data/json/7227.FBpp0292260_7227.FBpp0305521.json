Essential for embryonic viability and development. Required for coordinated peristaltic contractions. Recruited by Unc-13-4B to secretory lysosome-related organelles (SLs) that are essential for tracheal lumen fusion between previously separate tracheal branches (anastomosis). Possibly promotes the intracellular fusion of the extending tracheal stalk cell lumens  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Vesicle-fusing ATPase 1; Required for vesicle-mediated transport. Catalyzes the fusion of transport vesicles within the Golgi cisternae. Is also required for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi stack. Seems to function as a fusion protein required for the delivery of cargo proteins to all compartments of the Golgi stack independent of vesicle origin; Belongs to the AAA ATPase family",
