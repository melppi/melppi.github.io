The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity; Belongs to the peptidase T1B family",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Mediates the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Required for proper telomere behavior during cell divisions and possibly for ubiquitination of proteins involved in postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. Deletion mutations are lethal in homozygotes",
