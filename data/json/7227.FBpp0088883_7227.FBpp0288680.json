    "annotationA": "Endonuclease III homolog; Bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase with associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase function that catalyzes the first step in base excision repair (BER), the primary repair pathway for the repair of oxidative DNA damage. The DNA N-glycosylase activity releases the damaged DNA base from DNA by cleaving the N- glycosidic bond, leaving an AP site. The AP lyase activity cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3' to the AP site by a beta-elimination. Primarily recognizes and repairs oxidative base damage of pyrimidines; Belongs to the Nth/MutY family",
    "annotationB": "Recombination repair protein 1; Could promote homologous recombination at sites of DNA damage. Has apurinic endonuclease and double-stranded DNA 3'- exonuclease activities and carries out single-stranded DNA renaturation in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Activity is more efficient in purine-rich regions of dsDNA than in pyrimidine-rich regions; Belongs to the DNA repair enzymes AP/ExoA family",
