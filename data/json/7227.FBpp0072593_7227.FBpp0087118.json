    "annotationA": "Poly(U)-binding-splicing factor half pint; Splicing factor that regulates oogenesis and controls both mitosis and mRNA localization in the germline by regulating mRNA splicing of a subset of genes within the ovary. Probably acts by regulating the alternative splice site selection of the otu transcript. Also regulates the alternative splicing of eIF-4E and grk, while it is not involved in the splicing of par-1, sqd and psq; Belongs to the RRM half pint family",
    "annotationB": "Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmF (SmF) is an RNA binding protein that functions as part of a heteroheptameric ring structure called the Sm core. This complex binds to spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (e.g. U1, U2, U4 and U5) and helps to carry out pre-mRNA splicing. SmF also forms a heterotrimeric sub-complex with SmE and SNRPG",
