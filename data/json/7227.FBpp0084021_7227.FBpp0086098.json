    "annotationA": "Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, beta-subunit is a cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that catalyzes the ligation of Phenylalanine to its cognate tRNAPhe. Together with the alpha-subunit it forms a tetrameric enzyme complex. This subunit plays a role in recognition and binding of tRNAPhe and it provides the editing site that hydrolyzes wrongfully activated or ligated compounds",
    "annotationB": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit B; RNA-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is involved in protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs and, together with other initiation factors, stimulates binding of mRNA and methionyl-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation",
