Negatively regulates the Toll signaling pathway and suppresses the expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin. Its negative regulation of the Toll signaling pathway also results in the inhibition of the melanization immune response via the phenoloxidase (PPO1) cascade. Essential for unfolding and expansion of the wings after emergence from the pupal case. May regulate the Toll pathway by blocking the proteolysis of the Toll ligand spz",
