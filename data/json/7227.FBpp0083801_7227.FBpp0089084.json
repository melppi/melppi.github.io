At the endoplasmic reticulum, SEC13 is involved in the biogenesis of COPII-coated vesicles (By similarity). Recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin at the time of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Required for proper expression of ecdysone-responsive genes such as Eip74EF and Eip75B during larval development. Required for reactivation of transcription after heat shock.
