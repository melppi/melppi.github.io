    "annotationA": "26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 11; Component of the lid subcomplex of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. In the complex, RPN6 is required for proteasome assembly (By similarity). May act as linker between 19S regulatory subunit and the 20S proteasome core",
    "annotationB": "Cullin homolog 1; Core component of multiple SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which mediate the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. In the SCF complex, serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the SKP1-F-box protein and RBX1 subunits. May contribute to catalysis through positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. During early metamorphosis, part of the SCF-slmb complex that negatively regulates the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway to activate the pruning of unnecessary larva [...] ",
