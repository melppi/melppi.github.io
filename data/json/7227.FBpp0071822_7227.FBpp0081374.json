    "annotationA": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B; Cyclin B (CycB) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The complex CycB-Cdk1 complex induces the start of mitosis. During late metaphase of mitosis and continuing in G1, CycB is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity, and allowing termination of mitosis",
    "annotationB": "ATP-dependent RNA helicase bel; ATP-dependent RNA helicase that is essential and required for cellular function, larval growth, and for male and female fertility. Also required for RNA interference (RNAi), double-stranded RNA induces potent and specific gene silencing, by acting downstream of dsRNA internalization. RNAi is mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a sequence-specific, multicomponent nuclease that destroys or silences messenger RNAs homologous to the silencing trigger; Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family.
