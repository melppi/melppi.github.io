The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",

Acts synergistically with Rbf2 to antagonize E2f1-mediated transcriptional activation. Component of the DREAM complex, a multiprotein complex that can both act as a transcription activator or repressor depending on the context. The DREAM complex is required for recruiting E2f2 at differentiation-specific promoters and for stabilizing E2f2-Rbf complexes during S phase. During development, the complex represses trans [...] ",
