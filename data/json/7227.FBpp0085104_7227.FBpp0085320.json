    "annotationA": "Discs overgrown protein kinase; Involved in circadian rhythms, viability and molecular oscillations of the clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim). Dbt reduces the stability and thus the accumulation of monomeric per proteins, probably through phosphorylation. No evident circadian oscillation is detected in head. Together with CkIalpha, regulates processing of ci by phosphorylating it which promotes its binding to slmb, the F-box recognition component of the SCF(slmb) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CK1 Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Casein k [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Tyrosine-protein kinase Src42A; Required directly or indirectly for the phosphorylation of drpr which is necessary for the interaction of drpr with shark and subsequent glial phagocytic activity. Together with drpr and shark, promotes the migration of macrophages to sites of wounding as part of a signaling cascade where Scr42a detects production of hydrogen peroxide at wound sites which triggers phosphorylation of drpr and subsequent recruitment and activation of shark. Essential for correct eye morphogenesis (ommatidial R7 neuron formation) which requires the Ras1/MAPK signal transduc [...] ",
