The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity (By similarity); Belongs to the peptidase T1B family",
    "annotationB": "NF-kappa-B inhibitor cactus; Involved in the formation of the dorsoventral pattern. It inhibits nuclear translocation of the dorsal morphogen in the dorsal region of the embryo. Acts as a negative regulator of the NF-kappa-B (rel) signaling pathway. Cact is degraded by ird5, this is essential for NF-kappa-B (rel) activation",
