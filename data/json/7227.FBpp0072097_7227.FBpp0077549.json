Required for cytokinesis in both mitotic and meiotic cells and for aster migration and separation. Promotes cell motility during ovary development and oogenesis. During larval development, required for the cell rearrangement needed for formation of terminal filaments which are stacks of somatic cells that are important for the initiation of ovarioles. Also required for border cell migration during oogenesis. During border cell migration, required for actin tu [...] ",
