    "annotationA": "NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2; NAD-dependent histone deacetylase involved in heterochromatic silencing. Mildly suppresses the heterochromatin- mediated silencing phenomenon known as position-effect variegation (PEV). Required for epigenetic silencing of the polycomb group proteins. Has histone H4 deacetylase activity in vitro. Required maternally for establishing proper segmentation of the embryo. Involved in sex determination. May be involved in the regulation of life span",
    "annotationB": "Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase Su(var)3-9; Histone methyltransferase that specifically trimethylates 'Lys-9' of histone H3 using monomethylated H3 'Lys- 9' as substrate. H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting Su(var)205/HP1 to methylated histones. Mainly functions in heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin at pericentric regions. Involved in heterochromatic gene silencing including the modification of position-effect-variegation; Belongs to the c [...] ",
