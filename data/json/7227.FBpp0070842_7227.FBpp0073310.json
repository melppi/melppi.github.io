Its phosphorylation through the Rho-Rho Kinase pathway is predicted to activate myosin motor activity. Sqh and myosin function in cellular processes such as cytokinesis, and also contribute to tissue morphogenesis",
    "annotationB": "Segment polarity protein dishevelled; Required to establish coherent arrays of polarized cells and segments in embryos. Plays a role in wingless (wg) signaling, possibly through the reception of the wg signal by target cells and subsequent redistribution of arm protein in response to that signal in embryos. This signal seems to be required to establish planar cell polarity and identity",
