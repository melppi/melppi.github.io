Essential component of the phototransduction pathway. Essential downstream component of a hh-signaling pathway which regulates the Duox- dependent gut immune response to bacterial uracil; required for the activation of Cad99C and consequently Cad99C-dependent endosome formation, which is essential for the Duox-dependent produc [...] ",
