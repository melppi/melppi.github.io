    "annotationA": "Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmD3 (SmD3) is an RNA binding protein that forms a heterodimeric sub-complex with SmB. They function as part of the heteroheptameric ring complex Sm core, which is involved in the formation of spliceosomal small nuclear RNPs (U1, U2, U4 and U5), which together catalyze pre-mRNA splicing. SmD3 also has a function in germline specification, as it is required for localization of osk to the posterior pole of the oocyte",
    "annotationB": "Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5; Arginine methyltransferase that can both catalyze the formation of omega-N monomethylarginine (MMA) and symmetrical dimethylarginine (sDMA) (By similarity). Specifically mediates the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins SmD1 and SmD3. Required for arginine symmetrical dimethylation of piwi family proteins, piwi, aub and AGO3, during germline development. Required during oogenesis for pole cell formation in the pathway controlled by oskar (osk) and for abdominal segments during early embryogenesis. [...] ",
