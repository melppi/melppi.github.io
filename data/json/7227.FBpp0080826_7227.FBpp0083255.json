    "annotationB": "Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (Hs6st) is a heparan sulfate modifying enzyme, which transfers a sulfate group to the 6-O position of glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate. Loss of Hs6st eliminates 6-O sulfation, but increases 6-O sulfation performed by Hs2st. Simultaneous elimination of Hs6st and Hs2st disrupts FGF, Wg and Dpp signaling pathways",
