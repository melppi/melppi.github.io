    "annotationA": "Protein hedgehog; Intercellular signal essential for a variety of patterning events during development. Establishes the anterior- posterior axis of the embryonic segments and patterns the larval imaginal disks. Binds to the patched (ptc) receptor, which functions in association with smoothened (smo), to activate the transcription of target genes wingless (wg), decapentaplegic (dpp) and ptc. In the absence of hh, ptc represses the constitutive signaling activity of smo through fused (fu). Essential component of a signaling pathway which regulates the Duox-dependent gut immune response t [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Exostosin-1; Glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of heparan-sulfate and responsible for the alternating addition of beta-1-4-linked glucuronic acid (GlcA) and alpha-1-4-linked N- acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units to nascent heparan sulfate chains. Botv is the trigger of heparan sulfate chain initiation and polymerization takes place by a complex of ttv and sotv. Plays a central role in the diffusion of morphogens hedgehog (hh), wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) via its role in heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) biosynthesis which are required for movement of hh, d [...] ",
