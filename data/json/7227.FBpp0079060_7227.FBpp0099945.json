    "annotationA": "Protein wingless; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Segment polarity protein. May be a growth factor. Acts on neighboring cells to regulate at least one gene, the homeobox segmentation gene engrailed. Wg signal represses arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of engrailed autoactivation. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation. Wg also acts in the developing epidermis. Acts as a morphogen, [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Protein hedgehog; Intercellular signal essential for a variety of patterning events during development. Establishes the anterior- posterior axis of the embryonic segments and patterns the larval imaginal disks. Binds to the patched (ptc) receptor, which functions in association with smoothened (smo), to activate the transcription of target genes wingless (wg), decapentaplegic (dpp) and ptc. In the absence of hh, ptc represses the constitutive signaling activity of smo through fused (fu). Essential component of a signaling pathway which regulates the Duox-dependent gut immune response t [...] ",
