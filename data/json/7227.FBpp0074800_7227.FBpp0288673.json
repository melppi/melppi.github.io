    "annotationA": "ATP-dependent (S)-NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase; Catalyzes the dehydration of the S-form of NAD(P)HX at the expense of ATP, which is converted to ADP. Together with NAD(P)HX epimerase, which catalyzes the epimerization of the S- and R-forms, the enzyme allows the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX, a damaged form of NAD(P)H that is a result of enzymatic or heat-dependent hydration; Belongs to the NnrD/CARKD family",

This is a prerequisite for the S- specific NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase to allow the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX; Belongs to the NnrE/AIBP family",
