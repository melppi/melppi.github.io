    "annotationA": "TATA binding protein is a basal transcription factor required at most RNA Pol I and Pol II-transcribed genes in Drosophila. Traditionally thought to be recruited only to TATA box containing promoters, recent work shows that promoters with very weak TATA box consensus sequences also recruit TBP as a part of the multisubunit TFIID basal transcription factor or via the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex",
    "annotationB": "Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 5; TFIID is a multimeric protein complex that plays a central role in mediating promoter responses to various activators and repressors. May play a role in helping to anchor Taf4 within the TFIID complex. May be involved in transducing signals from various transcriptional regulators to the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery; Belongs to the WD repeat TAF5 family",
