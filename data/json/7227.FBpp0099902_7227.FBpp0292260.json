Phosphorylation of synapsin at serine 6 is required for associative short-term learning/memory and short-term olfactory habituation. It is important for outgrowth of synaptic boutons at the larval neuromuscular junction",

Essential for embryonic viability and development. Required for coordinated peristaltic contractions. Recruited by Unc-13-4B to secretory lysosome-related organelles (SLs) that are essential for tracheal lumen fusion between previously separate tracheal branches (anastomosis). Possibly promotes the intracellular fusion of the extending tracheal stalk cell lumens  [...] ",
