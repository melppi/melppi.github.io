Component of several complexes which regulate chromatin metabolism. These include the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, which is required for chromatin assembly following DNA replication and DNA repair; the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (the NuRD complex), which promotes transcriptional repression by histone deacetylati [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP18; Involved in the tethering of the SIN3 complex to core histone proteins. Interacts with bicoid (bcd) to repress transcription of bicoid target genes in the anterior tip of the embryo; a process known as retraction. Interacts with Trl and binds to Polycomb response elements at the bithorax complex. May contribute to the regulation of other homeotic gene expressions",
