Required maternally for the establishment of the normal array of embryonic segments: involved in the control of pair-rule gene transcription in a stripe-specific manner. Together with Hsp83 and piwi, mediates canalization, also known as developmental robustness, likely via epigenetic silencing of existing genetic variants and suppression of transposon-induced new genetic variation",
    "annotationB": "Protein enhancer of sevenless 2B; Required for proper signaling by sevenless. May act to stimulate the ability of Sos to catalyze Ras1 activation by linking sevenless and Sos in a signaling complex; Belongs to the GRB2/sem-5/DRK family",
