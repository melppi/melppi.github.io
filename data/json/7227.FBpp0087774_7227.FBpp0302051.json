The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity). Seems to function as a tumor suppressor by regulating Notch trafficking, hence preventing non-autonomous overproliferation. May be invo [...] ",
