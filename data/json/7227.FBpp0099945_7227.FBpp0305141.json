Establishes the anterior- posterior axis of the embryonic segments and patterns the larval imaginal disks. Binds to the patched (ptc) receptor, which functions in association with smoothened (smo), to activate the transcription of target genes wingless (wg), decapentaplegic (dpp) and ptc. In the absence of hh, ptc represses the constitutive signaling activity of smo through fused (fu).
