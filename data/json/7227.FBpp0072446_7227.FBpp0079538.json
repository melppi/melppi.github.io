    "annotationA": "RING-box protein 1B; Component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Through the RING-type zinc finger, seems to recruit the E2 ubiquitination enzyme to the complex and brings it into close proximity to the substrate (By similarity); Belongs to the RING-box family",
    "annotationB": "Proteasome subunit alpha type-1; The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity; Belongs to the peptidase T1A family",
