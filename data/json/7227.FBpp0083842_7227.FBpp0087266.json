    "annotationA": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; Synthesis of mevalonate for the production of non-sterol isoprenoids, which are essential for growth differentiation. Provides spatial information during embryogenesis to guide migrating primordial germ cells (the pole cells) from the ectoderm to the mesoderm. Also required for association of the pole cells with the gonadal mesoderm; Belongs to the HMG-CoA reductase family",
