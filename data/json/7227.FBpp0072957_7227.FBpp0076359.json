It is involved in the biological process described with: mitotic spindle elongation; translation; centrosome duplication; mitotic spindle organization; neurogenesis; Belongs to the eukaryotic ribosomal protein eL28 family",
    "annotationB": "Ribosomal protein L14 is a component of the large subunit of cytoplasmic ribosomes, which translate mRNAs encoded by the nuclear genome. The gene is haploinsufficient - heterozygous mutants display the 'Minute' phenotype, characterized by a slower developmental rate and small adult bristles",
