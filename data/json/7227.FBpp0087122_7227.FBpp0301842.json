    "annotationA": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) antizyme protein that negatively regulates ODC activity and intracellular polyamine biosynthesis and uptake in response to increased intracellular polyamine levels. Binds to ODC monomers, inhibiting the assembly of the functional ODC homodimer, and targets the monomers for ubiquitin- independent proteolytic destruction by the 26S proteasome (By similarity). Required for cellular differentiation in neuronal and myogenic lineages during embryonic development . ",
    "annotationB": "Proteasome inhibitor PI31 subunit; Plays an important role in the control of proteasome function. Inhibits the hydrolysis of protein and peptide substrates by the 20S proteasome. Enhances 26S proteasome function by promoting its assembly through the interaction with the assembly chaperones PSMD9 and PMSD5. Functions together with ntc to control non-apoptotic caspase activation during sperm individualization. In testis, is required for proper protein degradation and germline cell cycle progression",
