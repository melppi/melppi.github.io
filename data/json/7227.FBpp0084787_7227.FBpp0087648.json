    "annotationA": "Pre-mRNA-splicing factor Slu7; Participates in the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing, when the free hydroxyl group of exon I attacks the 3'- splice site to generate spliced mRNA and the excised lariat intron",
    "annotationB": "RNA-binding protein 8A; Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. Involved in exon definition of genes containing long introns, including the rolled/MAPK gene. The mago-tsu heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator Pym leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm. Has a role in oskar mRNA localization to the posterior pole of the developing oocyte; Belongs to the RBM8A family",
