Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone",

It is involved in the biological process described with: lateral inhibition; mitochondrial electron transport, NADH to ubiquinone; neuron projection morphogenesis; Belongs to the complex I 49 kDa subunit family",
