    "annotationA": "Small ubiquitin-related modifier; Smt3 is the only Drosophila SUMO family protein. It is required for embryonic patterning and mitosis. It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Borealin-related is one of the three targeting subunits for aurB kinase in the Chromosomal passenger complex. It helps to target the complex to the centromere region of chromosomes and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. At centromeres the complex is involved both in pausing mitotic progression when there are chromosome mis-attachments and in correcting those mis-attachments. At the cleavage furrow, the complex is involved in regulating the process of abscission (cell separation)",
