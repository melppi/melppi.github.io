    "annotationA": "Protein limb expression 1 homolog; Component of the Fat (ft) signaling pathway that functions in normal development of various organs such as the wing and leg. In developing imaginal disks, involved in regulating both the protein levels and apical localization of ft and ds. Involved in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) along the anterior- posterior axis of the wing (the early Fz signaling event), probably by acting upstream of ds and ft to regulate Fz activity",
    "annotationB": "Discs overgrown protein kinase; Involved in circadian rhythms, viability and molecular oscillations of the clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim). Dbt reduces the stability and thus the accumulation of monomeric per proteins, probably through phosphorylation. No evident circadian oscillation is detected in head. Together with CkIalpha, regulates processing of ci by phosphorylating it which promotes its binding to slmb, the F-box recognition component of the SCF(slmb) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CK1 Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Casein k [...] ",
