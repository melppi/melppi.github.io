It is recruited or stabilized by EndoA to endocytic membranes, and it catalyzes dephosphorylation reactions implicated in the uncoating of nascent endocytic vesicles. When Synj dephosphorylates phosphoinositides on nascent vesicles, endocytic adaptors with affinity for these lipids will leave the membrane to uncoat the vesicle",
