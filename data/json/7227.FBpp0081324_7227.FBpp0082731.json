    "annotationA": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III; ATP-dependent RNA helicase. Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. Involved in exon definition of genes containing long introns, including the rolled/MAPK gene. Has a role in oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the developing oocyte",
    "annotationB": "Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP18; Involved in the tethering of the SIN3 complex to core histone proteins. Interacts with bicoid (bcd) to repress transcription of bicoid target genes in the anterior tip of the embryo; a process known as retraction. Interacts with Trl and binds to Polycomb response elements at the bithorax complex. May contribute to the regulation of other homeotic gene expressions",
