    "annotationA": "Protein wntless; A segment polarity gene required for wingless (wg)- dependent patterning processes, acting in both wg-sending cells and wg-target cells. In non-neuronal cells wls directs wg secretion. The wls traffic loop encompasses the Golgi, the cell surface, an endocytic compartment and a retrograde route leading back to the Golgi, and involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the retromer complex (a conserved protein complex consisting of Vps35 and Vps26). In neuronal cells (the larval motorneuron NMJ), the wg signal moves across the synapse via the release of wls- containing ex [...] ",

Serine palmitoleylation of Wnt proteins is required for efficient binding to frizzled receptors (By similarity). Also facilitates the glycosylation of Wnt family members, including wg and Wnt5. The cotranslational disulfide bond formation of wg competes with the N-glycosylation. Porc stimulates the post-translational N-glycosylat [...] ",
