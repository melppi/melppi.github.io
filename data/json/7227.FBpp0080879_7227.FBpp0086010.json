Required for synthesis and/or stability of oskar protein (osk) and localization of tudor (tud) in both the nuage and posterior pole of the oocyte. Required for normal posterior localization of osk in later stages of oogenesis and for posterior localization of the vasa (vas) protein during the entire process of pole plasm assembly.

    "annotationB": "Methylosome subunit pICln; Chaperone that regulates the assembly of spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm comple [...] ",
