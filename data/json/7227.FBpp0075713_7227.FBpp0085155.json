Coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. Required for limiting lipid storage in lipid droplets. Involved in the expansion of luminal extracellular matrices and apical membrane during tubulogenesis. Required [...] ",
