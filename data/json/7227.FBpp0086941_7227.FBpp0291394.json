    "annotationA": "Amphiphysin, isoform A; Phospholipid binding. It is involved in the biological process described with: exocytosis; protein localization; rhabdomere development; synaptic vesicle endocytosis; endocytosis; neurotransmitter secretion; rhabdomere membrane biogenesis; regulation of muscle contraction",
    "annotationB": "Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein LAP; Assembly protein recruiting clathrin and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) to cell membranes at sites of coated-pit formation and clathrin-vesicle assembly. May be required to determine the amount of membrane to be recycled, possibly by regulating the size of the clathrin cage. Involved in AP2-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction; Belongs to the PICALM/SNAP91 family",
