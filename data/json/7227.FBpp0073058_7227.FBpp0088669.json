As part of the Non-Specific Lethal complex, it regulates transcription of housekeeping genes by facilitating recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters. During mitosis it plays a key role in chromosomal-dependent microtubule assembly, centriole duplication and pericentriolar material maturation",
