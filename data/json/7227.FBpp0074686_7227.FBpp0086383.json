    "annotationA": "Polycomb protein Su(z)12; Polycomb group (PcG) protein. While PcG proteins are generally required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development, this protein is specifically required during the first 6 hours of embryogenesis to establish the repressed state. Component of the Esc/E(z) complex, which methylates 'Lys-9' (H3K9me) and 'Lys-27' (H3K27me) of histone H3, leading to transcriptional repression of the affected target gene. The Esc/E(z) complex is necessary but not sufficient for the repression of homeotic target genes, suggesting that [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase calypso; Polycomb group (PcG) protein. Catalytic component of the PR-DUB complex, a complex that specifically mediates deubiquitination of histone H2A monoubiquitinated at 'Lys-118' (H2AK118ub1). Does not deubiquitinate monoubiquitinated histone H2B. Required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development. The PR-DUB complex has weak or no activity toward 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains; Belongs to the peptidase C12 family. BAP1 subfamily",
