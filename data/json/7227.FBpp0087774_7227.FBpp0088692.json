    "annotationA": "Vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 25; Component of the ESCRT-II complex (ensodomal sorting complex required for transport II), which is required for multivesicular body (MVB) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity). Seems to function as a tumor suppressor by regulating Notch trafficking, hence preventing non-autonomous overproliferation. May be invo [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; Essential role in endosome membrane invagination and formation of multivesicular bodies, MVBs. Required during gastrulation and appears to regulate early embryonic signaling pathways. Inhibits tyrosine kinase receptor signaling by promoting degradation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated, active receptor, potentially by sorting activated receptors into MVBs. The MVBs are then trafficked to the lysosome where their contents are degraded",
