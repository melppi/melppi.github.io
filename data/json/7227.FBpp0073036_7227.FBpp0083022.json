    "annotationA": "Caffeine, calcium, zinc sensitivity 1 (Ccz1) forms a complex with Mon1 and acts as an exchange factor of the small G-protein Rab7. The Ccz1/Mon1 complex activates and recruits Rab7 to the maturing endosome, where Rab7 organizes the fusion of the matured endosome with the lysosome. Ccz1/Mon1 complex loss of function results in Rab7 phenotypes",

It is involved in the biological process described with: regulation of SNARE complex assembly; cellular response to starvation; vesicle-mediated transport; autophagic vacuole fusion; neuron projection morphogenesis; regulation of Notch signaling pathway; intracellular protein transport",
