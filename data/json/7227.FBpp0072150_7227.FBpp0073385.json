The SAGA complex is a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates histone H2B. The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators, where it is required for transcription. Required for nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation. Involved in t [...] ",
