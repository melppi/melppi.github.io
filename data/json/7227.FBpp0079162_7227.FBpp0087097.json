During embryogenesis, not involved in the wash-dependent developmental migration of hemocytes anteriorly from the tail",
    "annotationB": "WASH complex subunit 1; Acts as a nucleation-promoting factor by activating the Arp2/3 complex to induce actin polymerization. Participates in both linear- and branched-actin networks. Functions in linear-filament (bundled F-actin) by acting downstream of Rho1 and regulating actin and microtubule organization during oogenesis. Nucleates actin in an Arp2/3-dependent manner and exhibits F-actin and microtubule bundling and cross-linking activity in the egg chamber. During embryogenesis, acts downstream of Rho1 to activate the Arp2/3 complex which is necessary for the developmental migrat [...] ",
