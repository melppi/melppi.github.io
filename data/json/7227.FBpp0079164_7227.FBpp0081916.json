In flies the majority of Trf substitutes for Tbp in Pol III transcription in complex with Brf. The rest of Trf initiates transcription of a small subset of PolII-transcribed genes regulating fly fertility and nervous system function",
    "annotationB": "TBP-associated factor 12 (Taf12) is part of the multisubunit basal transcription factor TFIID, and it is important for its stability. It forms a histone-like pair with Taf4. Taf12 is also an integral component of the Drosophila SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex",
