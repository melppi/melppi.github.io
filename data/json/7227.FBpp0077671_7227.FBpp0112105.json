    "annotationA": "Gustatory and odorant receptor 21a; Gustatory and odorant receptor which mediates acceptance or avoidance behavior, depending on its substrates. Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for carbon dioxide detection and avoidance behavior. It is possible that the CO(2) receptors Gr63a and Gr21a activate the TRPC channels through Galpha49B and Plc21C. This innate olfactory avoidance behavior can be inhibited by inhibitory interactions of the odors such as 1-hexanol and 2,3- butanedione with Gr21a and Gr63a; Belongs to the insect chemoreceptor superfamily. Gustatory receptor (GR) family. G [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Odorant receptor coreceptor; Odorant coreceptor which complexes with conventional odorant receptors (ORs) to form odorant-sensing units, providing sensitive and prolonged odorant signaling and calcium permeability. Orco is a universal and integral part of the functional odorant receptor, involved in the dendritic localization of other olfactory receptors. Expression of Orco alone leads to formation of rapid and transient ion channels not directly responding to odorants, but directly activated by intracellular cAMP or cGMP. Snmp, Or67d and lush act in concert to capture fatty-acid-deriv [...] ",
