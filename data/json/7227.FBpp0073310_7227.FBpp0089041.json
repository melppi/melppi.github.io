Plays a role in wingless (wg) signaling, possibly through the reception of the wg signal by target cells and subsequent redistribution of arm protein in response to that signal in embryos. This signal seems to be required to establish planar cell polarity and identity",

The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity (By similarity); Belongs to the peptidase T1A family",
