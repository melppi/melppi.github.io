    "annotationB": "Recombination repair protein 1; Could promote homologous recombination at sites of DNA damage. Has apurinic endonuclease and double-stranded DNA 3'- exonuclease activities and carries out single-stranded DNA renaturation in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Activity is more efficient in purine-rich regions of dsDNA than in pyrimidine-rich regions; Belongs to the DNA repair enzymes AP/ExoA family",
