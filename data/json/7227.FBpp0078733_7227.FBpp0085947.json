    "annotationA": "Lamin Dm0; Lamins are components of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous layer on the nucleoplasmic side of the inner nuclear membrane, which is thought to provide a framework for the nuclear envelope and may also interact with chromatin. May have a role in the localization of the LEM domain proteins Ote, bocks and MAN1 to the nuclear membrane. In spermatocytes, plays a role in maintaining type-A lamin LamC nuclear localization; regulates meiotic cytokinesis by maintaining the structure of the spindle envelope, and by contributing to the formation of the contractile ring and central spindle",
    "annotationB": "Otefin; Inner nuclear membrane protein. Involved in the attachment of membrane vesicles to chromatin during nuclear assembly, and is probably required for centrosome maturation and cell cycle progression during mitosis. Essential for differentiation of certain tissues and the maintenance of progenitor cell populations. Required for the differentiation and maintenance of male and female germline stem cells (GSCs), as well as the maintenance of somatic cells in the GSC niche. This role is likely to be independent of the BMP (Dpp) pathway that negatively regulates bam transcription during [...] ",
