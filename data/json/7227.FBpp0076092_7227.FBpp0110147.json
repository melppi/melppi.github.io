    "annotationA": "Calcium-independent phospholipase A2 VIA (IPLA2-VIA) localizes to cytosol and mitochondria. IPLA2-VIA has a role in repairing oxidized mitochondrial lipids, such as cardiolipin, and thus preventing cytochrome c release. IPLA2-VIA is partially responsible for cardiolipin depletion and monolysocardiolipin accumulation in Taz-deficient flies, which is a model of Barth syndrome",

Has a calcium-independent activity (By similarity). Displays a clear preference for saturated fatty acyl- CoAs, and 1-myristoyl or 1-palmitoyl LPC as acyl donors and acceptors, respectively (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of lipid droplet number and size",
