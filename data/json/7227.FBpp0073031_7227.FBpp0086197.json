    "annotationB": "Protein kinase C, brain isozyme; PKC is activated by diacylglycerol which in turn phosphorylates a range of cellular proteins (By similarity). PKC also serves as the receptor for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters (By similarity). Acts in a hh-signaling pathway which regulates the Duox-dependent gut immune response to bacterial uracil; required for the activation of Cad99C and consequently Cad99C-dependent endosome formation, which is essential for the Duox-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to intestinal bacterial infection",
