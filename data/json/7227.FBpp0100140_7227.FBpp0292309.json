Thereby, may play a role in Golgi membrane trafficking and could indirectly give its flattened shape to the Golgi apparatus (By similarity). May also bind to the coatomer to regulate Golgi membrane trafficking. May play a role in anterograde transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and regulate secretion (By similarity).
