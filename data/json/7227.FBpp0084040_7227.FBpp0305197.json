Regulates a number of genes involved in wing development including activation of net and bs and repression of rho and kni and controls vein-intervein patterning during wing development. Required for correct expression of a number of homeotic genes including Scr in the first leg imaginal disk and Ubx in the third leg imaginal disk and haltere disks.
