    "annotationA": "Protein wingless; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Segment polarity protein. May be a growth factor. Acts on neighboring cells to regulate at least one gene, the homeobox segmentation gene engrailed. Wg signal represses arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of engrailed autoactivation. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation. Wg also acts in the developing epidermis. Acts as a morphogen, [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Groucho (Gro) is a global developmental co-repressor in conjunction with manifold DNA-binding repressor partner proteins, which tether it to target promoters. Groucho functions downstream of key signaling pathways such as Wg/Wnt and Dpp/TGF-beta. Notably, phosphorylation of Gro in response to MAPK activation weakens its repressor capacity",
