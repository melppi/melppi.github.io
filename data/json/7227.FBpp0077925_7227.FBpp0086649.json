Possesses fucose- specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity; extends the O-linked fucose on the Notch EGF repeats. Boundary- specific cell-signaling molecule that is responsible for dorsal- ventral cell interactions during wing development",
    "annotationB": "GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase 1; Catalyzes the reaction that attaches fucose through an O-glycosidic linkage to a conserved serine or threonine residue found in the consensus sequence C2-X(4,5)-[S/T]-C3 of EGF domains, where C2 and C3 are the second and third conserved cysteines. Specifically uses GDP-fucose as donor substrate and proper disulfide pairing of the substrate EGF domains is required for fucose transfer. Plays a crucial role in Notch signaling. Initial fucosylation of Notch/N by POFUT1 generates a substrate for Fringe/Fng, an acetylglucosaminyltransferase that can [...] ",
