Contributes to endodermal integrity and adhesion between the midgut epithelium and the surrounding visceral muscle. Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium. The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/talin and Itgbn does not. Required for rhea/talin correct cellular localization in the midgut.
