The active ATPase sites in the Mcm2-7 ring are formed through the interaction surfaces of two neighboring subunits such that a critical structure of a conserved arginine finger motif is provided in trans relative to the ATP- binding site of the Walker A box of the adjacent subunit. The six ATPase active sites, however, are likely to contribu [...] ",
