Zfrp8 functions in the formation of mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. Zfrp8 may regulate the binding of specific mRNPs to the small ribosomal subunit, ultimately controlling their cytoplasmic localization and translation",
    "annotationB": "Synaptic functional regulator FMR1; Polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of protein synthesis of mRNAs. Plays a role as a negative translational regulator of specific mRNAs. Represses translation of the microtubule-associated protein futsch mRNA to regulate microtubule-dependent synaptic growth and function. May also be involved in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational suppression. Required for stability of the central pair of microtubules in the spermatid axoneme. Regulates photoreceptor  [...] ",
