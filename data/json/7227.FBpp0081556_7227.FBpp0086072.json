    "annotationA": "Spermidine synthase activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: spermidine biosynthetic process; Belongs to the spermidine/spermine synthase family",
    "annotationB": "S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase; Catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of S-methyl-5'- thioadenosine (MTA) to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate. Involved in the breakdown of MTA, a major by-product of polyamine biosynthesis. Responsible for the first step in the methionine salvage pathway after MTA has been generated from S- adenosylmethionine. Has broad substrate specificity with 6- aminopurine nucleosides as preferred substrates; Belongs to the PNP/MTAP phosphorylase family. MTAP subfamily",
