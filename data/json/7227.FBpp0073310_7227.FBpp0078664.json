Plays a role in wingless (wg) signaling, possibly through the reception of the wg signal by target cells and subsequent redistribution of arm protein in response to that signal in embryos. This signal seems to be required to establish planar cell polarity and identity",

The 26S proteasome is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The function of the 'Lys-63'-specific deubiquitination of the proteasome is unclear (By similarity)",
