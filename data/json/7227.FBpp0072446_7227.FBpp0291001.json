Through the RING-type zinc finger, seems to recruit the E2 ubiquitination enzyme to the complex and brings it into close proximity to the substrate (By similarity); Belongs to the RING-box family",
    "annotationB": "Succinate--CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial; ATP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase functions in the citric acid cycle (TCA), coupling the hydrolysis of succinyl-CoA to the synthesis of ATP and thus represents the only step of substrate-level phosphorylation in the TCA. The beta subunit provides nucleotide specificity of the enzyme and binds the substrate succinate, while the binding sites for coenzyme A and phosphate are found in the alpha subunit",
