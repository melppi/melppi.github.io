    "annotationA": "Homeobox protein homothorax; All isoforms are required for patterning of the embryonic cuticle. Acts with exd to delimit the eye field and prevent inappropriate eye development. Isoforms that carry the homeodomain are required for proper localization of chordotonal organs within the peripheral nervous system and antennal identity; required to activate antennal-specific genes, such as sal and to repress the leg-like expression of dac. Necessary for the nuclear localization of the essential HOX cofactor, extradenticle (exd). Both necessary and sufficient for inner photoreceptors to adopt [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Homeotic protein ultrabithorax; Sequence-specific transcription factor which is part of a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior axis. Binds the consensus region 5'-TTAAT[GT][GA]-3'. This homeotic protein controls development of the cells in the posterior thoracic and first abdominal segments. It activates the synthesis of the decapentaplegic (DPP) growth factor; Belongs to the Antp homeobox family",
