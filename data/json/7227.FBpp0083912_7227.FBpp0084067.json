TFIIA in a complex with TBP mediates transcriptional activity. Part of a rhi-dependent transcription machinery that enables the generation of piRNA precursors from heterochromatin while maintaining the suppression of transposon-encoded promoters and enhancers. Forms a complex with Moonshiner/CG12721 and Trf2 which recruit transcriptional machinery to heterochromatin to initiate the bidirectional transcription  [...] ",

Common component of RNA polymerases I, II and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors, mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs, and a small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Pols are composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. In Pol II, RBP10 is part of the core [...] ",
