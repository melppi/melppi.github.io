    "annotationA": "14-3-3 protein zeta; Required in Raf-dependent cell proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation during eye development. Acts upstream of Raf and downstream of Ras, and is essential for viability. Acts as a negative regulator of the slo calcium channel via its interaction with slo- binding protein slob. Inhibits yki activity by restricting its nuclear localization. Binds to and promotes the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase Pi3K68D which converts phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol-3- phosphate and promotes maturation of early endosomes",
    "annotationB": "Armadillo segment polarity protein; Isoform neural may associate with CadN and participate in the transmission of developmental information. Can associate with alpha-catenin. Isoform cytoplasmic accumulates through wg signaling; arm function in wg signal transduction is required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Arm and Abl proteins function cooperatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and epidermis; Belongs to the beta-catenin family",
