    "annotationA": "Protein mago nashi; Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. Involved in exon definition of genes containing long introns, including the rolled/MAPK gene. The mago-tsu heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator Pym leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm. Has a role in oskar mRNA localization to the posterior pole of the developing oocyte, and may also be involved in polarization of the oocyte microtubule cytoskeleton",
    "annotationB": "Regulator of nonsense transcripts 1 homolog; RNA-dependent helicase and ATPase required for nonsense- mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons. Is recruited to mRNAs upon translation termination and undergoes a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; its phosphorylation appears to be a key step in NMD. The formation of an Upf1-Upf2-Upf3 surveillance complex is believed to activate NMD (By similarity)",
