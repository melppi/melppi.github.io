It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway; negative regulation of growth of symbiont in host; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity; actin cytoskeleton organization; autophagic vacuole fusion; intracellular protein transport",
    "annotationB": "Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) is an ESCRT-I complex component that acts as an adapter for membrane rearrangements operated by ESCRT-III. TSG101 roles include endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated cargoes, which is important for signaling regulation, cytokinesis, and budding of viruses and exovesicles",
