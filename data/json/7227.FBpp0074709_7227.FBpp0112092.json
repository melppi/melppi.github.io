Taf6 is required during all stages of Drosophila development, but particularly imaginal disc development and gametogenesis",
    "annotationB": "SAGA-associated factor 11 homolog; Component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA, a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates histone H2B. The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators, where it is required for transcription. Required for nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation. Binds independently on SAGA to promoters in an RNA-dependent manner. Binds [...] ",
