    "annotationA": "Cryptocephal, isoform A; Cryptocephal (Crc) belongs to a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic-leucine zipper transcription factors. Crc serves as an EcR coactivator to promote expression the molting peptide hormone ETH. Crc also acts as an unfolded protein response transcription factor to regulate glycolytic genes in response to ER stress",
    "annotationB": "X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1) is a transcription factor that mediates the Unfolded Protein Response. The mRNA of xbp1 undergoes splicing after being cleaved by Ire1, inducing the expression of ER quality control transcripts. Xbp1 mutants fail to develop beyond the 2nd instar larval stage, indicative of a requirement to resolve inherent ER stress during normal development",
