Probably acts by regulating the alternative splice site selection of the otu transcript. Also regulates the alternative splicing of eIF-4E and grk, while it is not involved in the splicing of par-1, sqd and psq; Belongs to the RRM half pint family",

It is involved in the biological process described with: negative regulation of mRNA splicing, via spliceosome; regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, via spliceosome; spermatogenesis; mRNA processing; regulation of mRNA splicing, via spliceosome",
