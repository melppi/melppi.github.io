After Cbl-mediated ubiquitination, the substrates will be targeted to protein degradation for controlling cell growth, survival, migration and inflammation",
    "annotationB": "Ras-like protein 1; Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). Plays a role in eye development by regulating cell growth, survival of postmitotic ommatidial cells and differentiation of photoreceptor cells. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, a hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis",
