The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",
