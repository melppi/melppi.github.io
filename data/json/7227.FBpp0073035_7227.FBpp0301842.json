    "annotationA": "Polyubiquitin; Ubiquitin exists either covalently attached to another protein, or free (unanchored). When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradatio [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Proteasome inhibitor PI31 subunit; Plays an important role in the control of proteasome function. Inhibits the hydrolysis of protein and peptide substrates by the 20S proteasome. Enhances 26S proteasome function by promoting its assembly through the interaction with the assembly chaperones PSMD9 and PMSD5. Functions together with ntc to control non-apoptotic caspase activation during sperm individualization. In testis, is required for proper protein degradation and germline cell cycle progression",
