The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein Hippo (Hpo), in complex with its regulatory protein Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts) in complex with its regulatory protein Mats, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein. The Hippo/SWH signaling pathway inhibits the act [...] ",
