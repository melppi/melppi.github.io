Required for transcriptional silencing of transposons targeted by piwi and confers its effects by interacting with nascent RNA transcripts. Likely to be recruited to nascent transcripts cotranscriptionally by piwi and to recruit additional factors involved in transcriptional silencing",

Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. In ovarian somatic cells, mediates silencing of transposable elements at the transcriptional level in a mael- dependent manner. [...] ",
