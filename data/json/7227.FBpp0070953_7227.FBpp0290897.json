The adapter phyl is required to direct the degradation of the two isoforms of the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack (Ttk). E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin- conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates. It probably triggers the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of different substrates. A phyl-independent mechanism of degradation exists for [...] ",
