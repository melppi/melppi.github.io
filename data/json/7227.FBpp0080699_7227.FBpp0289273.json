Required in early stages of leg development for the intercalation of the tarsal segments during the mid-third instar stage and later for tarsal joint formation. Promotes the post-translational modification of ovo isoform B (svb) into its active form which in turn initiates trichome development and promotes tarsal joint development. This is likely due to recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Ubr3 to svb [...] ",
