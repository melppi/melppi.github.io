    "annotationA": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by initiating polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, leading to the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
    "annotationB": "RE72064p; Mad2 is a conserved component of the spindle checkpoint. During mitosis, it is recruited to unattached kinetochores, where it binds Mad1 and fzy, promoting the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex. During interphase, Mad2 is intranuclear, bound to Mad1, and associated primarily with the nuclear pore complex",
