    "annotationB": "Nucleotide excision repair protein ERCC1; Ercc1 is the non-catalytic partner of the mei-9 nuclease that cuts structures formed during DNA repair. The mei-9-Ercc1 heterodimer interacts with mus312 to make meiotic crossovers. Ercc1 functions include repair of UV-induced DNA damage, repair of base adducts, a backup pathway for mismatch repair and meiotic recombination",
