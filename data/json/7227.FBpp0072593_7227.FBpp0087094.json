    "annotationA": "Poly(U)-binding-splicing factor half pint; Splicing factor that regulates oogenesis and controls both mitosis and mRNA localization in the germline by regulating mRNA splicing of a subset of genes within the ovary. Probably acts by regulating the alternative splice site selection of the otu transcript. Also regulates the alternative splicing of eIF-4E and grk, while it is not involved in the splicing of par-1, sqd and psq; Belongs to the RRM half pint family",
    "annotationB": "Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmD3 (SmD3) is an RNA binding protein that forms a heterodimeric sub-complex with SmB. They function as part of the heteroheptameric ring complex Sm core, which is involved in the formation of spliceosomal small nuclear RNPs (U1, U2, U4 and U5), which together catalyze pre-mRNA splicing. SmD3 also has a function in germline specification, as it is required for localization of osk to the posterior pole of the oocyte",
