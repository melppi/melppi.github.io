    "annotationB": "Vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (Vamp7) is an R type SNARE protein. It mediates the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes and lysosomes by forming a SNARE complex with Syx17 (Qa) and Snap29 (Qbc). Vamp7 localizes to endosomes in a Rab21 and Sbf dependent manner; Belongs to the synaptobrevin family",
