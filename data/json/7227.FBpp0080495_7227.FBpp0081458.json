Subunit H activates the ATPase activity of the enzyme and couples ATPase activity to proton flow. Vacuolar ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, thus providing most of the energy required for transport processes in the vacuolar system (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Vacuolar H[+] ATPase M8.9 accessory subunit; Frizzled-2 binding; frizzled binding; receptor activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: Wnt signaling pathway; endosomal transport; Wnt signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway; ATP hydrolysis coupled proton transport; imaginal disc-derived wing hair organization; establishment of body hair or bristle planar orientation; protein localization involved in establishment of planar polarity; establishment of imaginal disc-derived wing hair orientation",
