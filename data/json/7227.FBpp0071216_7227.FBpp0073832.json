It is involved in the biological process described with: negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; leg disc proximal/distal pattern formation; imaginal disc-derived leg morphogenesis; regulation of gene expression; positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; compound eye development; regulation of transcription, DNA-templated",
    "annotationB": "Inhibitory POU protein; Modulates gene transcription; simultaneously generates both a specific activator and an inhibitor of gene transcription, capable of modulating two distinct regulatory programs during neural development. Has a role in olfactory behavior; Belongs to the POU transcription factor family. Class- 4 subfamily",
