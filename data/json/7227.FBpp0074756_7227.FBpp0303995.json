    "annotationA": "RuvB-like helicase 2; Acts as a transcriptional coactivator in Wg signaling caused by altered arm signaling. Pont and rept interfere antagonistically with nuclear arm signaling function, and are required to enhance or reduce arm activity, respectively. Also an essential cofactor for the normal function of Myc; required for cellular proliferation and growth",
    "annotationB": "Myc protein; Participates in the regulation of gene transcription. Binds DNA in a non-specific manner, yet also specifically recognizes the core sequence CAC[GA]TG. Seems to activate the transcription of growth-related genes; required for cellular proliferation and growth. Functions in the TORC2- mediated regulation of cell growth, acting downstream of the TORC2 complex. Inhibits the demethylase activity of Lid. Activates transcription of mbm. Able to induce the SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase member archipelago (ago) which functions in its degradation. It may therefore create a negati [...] ",
