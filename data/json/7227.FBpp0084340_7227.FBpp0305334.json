    "annotationB": "Charged multivesicular body protein 5; Probable peripherally associated component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins (By similarity). Specifically down-regulates Notch signaling activity in the germarium, probably by facilitating Notch en [...] ",
