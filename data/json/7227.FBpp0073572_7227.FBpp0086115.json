    "annotationA": "Brahma-associated protein of 60 kDa; Involved in the recruitment and site-specific anchoring of the Brahma complex at specific promoter sites. The Brahma complex is a multiprotein complex which is the equivalent of the yeast SWI/SNF complex and acts by remodeling the chromatin by catalyzing an ATP-dependent alteration in the structure of nucleosomal DNA. This complex can both serve as a transcriptional coactivator or corepressor, depending on the context. Participates in X-chromosomal dosage compensation",
    "annotationB": "Brahma associated protein 55kD; Transcription coactivator activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: mitotic nuclear division; muscle organ development; chromatin remodeling; mitotic cytokinesis; positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; dendrite guidance; DNA repair; dendrite morphogenesis; positive regulation of gene silencing by miRNA; Belongs to the actin family",
