It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",

Selectively required for the nuclear import of the Rel family transcription factors dorsal (dl) and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) and the activation of an immune response. Required for the anchoring of Nup214 and emb on the nuclear envelope and thereby attenuates nuclear export signal (NES)-mediated nuclear export",
