It mediates the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes and lysosomes by forming a SNARE complex with Snap29 (Qbc) and Vamp7 (R). Syx17 roles include autophagosome clearance and neuromuscular function",
    "annotationB": "Syntaxin-1A; Plays a critical role in several secretory processes, including cuticle secretion and neurotransmitter release, and probably assists in neuronal membrane maturation or the final stages of neuronal differentiation. Essential for embryonic viability and development. Required for coordinated peristaltic contractions. Recruited by Unc-13-4B to secretory lysosome-related organelles (SLs) that are essential for tracheal lumen fusion between previously separate tracheal branches (anastomosis). Possibly promotes the intracellular fusion of the extending tracheal stalk cell lumens  [...] ",
