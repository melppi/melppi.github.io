    "annotationA": "Importin subunit alpha; Pendulin (Pen) is a member of the Importin-alpha protein family, an essential adaptor in the Ran-GTP nuclear transport cycle binding a cargo protein to the nuclear import receptor Fs(2)Ket. In addition to nuclear protein import, Pendulin is involved in centrosome duplication, mitotic spindle dynamics, nuclear envelope assembly, ring canal formation in the female germline, geotaxic behaviour and perception of pain",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore glycoprotein p62; Essential component of the nuclear pore complex (By similarity). The N-terminal is probably involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (By similarity). The C-terminal is involved in protein-protein interaction probably via coiled-coil formation, promotes its association with centrosomes and may function in anchorage of Nup62 to the pore complex (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active genes. Negatively regulates chromatin attachment to the nuclear envelope, probably by preventing chromatin tethering by Nup154",
