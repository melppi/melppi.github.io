    "annotationA": "Integrin beta-nu; Contributes to endodermal integrity and adhesion between the midgut epithelium and the surrounding visceral muscle. Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium. Can only partially compensate for the loss of beta-PS integrin during primordial midgut cell migration. The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/Talin and beta-nu does not. Integrin alpha-PS3/beta- nu is required for effective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells during em [...] ",
    "annotationB": "RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase; Serine/threonine kinase involved in various developmental processes. During early embryogenesis, acts as a survival protein. During mid-embryogenesis, phosphorylates and activates trh, a transcription factor required for tracheal cell fate determination. Also regulates tracheal cell migration. Later in development, acts downstream of PI3K and Pk61C/PDK1 in the insulin receptor transduction pathway which regulates cell growth and organ size, by phosphorylating and antagonizing FOXO transcription factor. Controls follicle cell size during oogenesis. M [...] ",
