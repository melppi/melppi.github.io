    "annotationA": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Required for postreplication repair of UV-damaged DNA. Involved in the negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway in the wing by acting with the putative E3 ligases poe, Kcmf1 and Ufd4 to mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of rl/MAPK; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
    "annotationB": "Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 catalytic subunit; Catalytic subunit of the dimeric Uba3-APP-BP1 E1 enzyme. E1 activates Nedd8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a Nedd8-Uba3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers Nedd8 to the catalytic cysteine of Ubc12. Required for Cul1 and Cul3 neddylation. Negatively regulates full-length ci stability and hedgehog signaling",
