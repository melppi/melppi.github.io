    "annotationA": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; mRNA-binding protein involved in translation elongation. Has an important function at the level of mRNA turnover, probably acting downstream of decapping. Involved in actin dynamics and cell cycle progression, mRNA decay and probably in a pathway involved in stress response and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Functions as a regulator of apoptosis; Belongs to the eIF-5A family",
    "annotationB": "Ribosomal protein S3A is an essential component of the small ribosomal subunit that functions in protein synthesis. It is classified as a 'Minute' gene as heterozygous mutants exhibit a slower developmental rate and small adult bristles",
