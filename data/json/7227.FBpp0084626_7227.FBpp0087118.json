It is involved in the biological process described with: translational elongation; positive regulation of Ras protein signal transduction; positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade; mRNA splicing, via spliceosome",
    "annotationB": "Small ribonucleoprotein particle protein SmF (SmF) is an RNA binding protein that functions as part of a heteroheptameric ring structure called the Sm core. This complex binds to spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (e.g. U1, U2, U4 and U5) and helps to carry out pre-mRNA splicing. SmF also forms a heterotrimeric sub-complex with SmE and SNRPG",
