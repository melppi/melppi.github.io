The TIM22 complex forms a twin- pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as the external driving force. In the TIM22 complex, it may act as a docking point for the soluble 70 kDa complex that guides the target proteins in transit through the aqueous mitochondrial intermembrane space (By similarity)",
