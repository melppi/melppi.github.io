    "annotationA": "Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase; Pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes non-canonical purine nucleotides such as inosine triphosphate (ITP), deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) or xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP) to their respective monophosphate derivatives. The enzyme does not distinguish between the deoxy- and ribose forms. Probably excludes non-canonical purines from RNA and DNA precursor pools, thus preventing their incorporation into RNA and DNA and avoiding chromosomal lesions",
    "annotationB": "Soluble guanylate cyclase 89Da; Heterodimers with Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db are activated in response to changing oxygen concentrations, alerting flies to hypoxic environments. Under normal oxygen concentrations, oxygen binds to the heme group and results in low levels of guanylyl cyclase activity. When exposed to reduced oxygen concentrations, the oxygen dissociates from the heme group resulting in activation of the enzyme",
