Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone",
    "annotationB": "NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 51 kDa subunit is a flavoprotein and iron-sulfur-containing oxidoreductase that catalyzes the oxidation of NADH to NAD. It is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport complex I, which is part of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. It may have a role in regulating aggression behavior",
