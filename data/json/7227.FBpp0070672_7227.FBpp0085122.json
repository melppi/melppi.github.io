    "annotationA": "Dynein light chain 1, cytoplasmic; Cut up (Ctp) is the 8 kDa (LC8/DLC1) subunit of the cytoplasmic Dynein, as well as the Myosin V. It homodimerizes and binds to a variety of proteins. It is involved in both dynein-dependent and independent functions such as cell viability, axonal guidance, spermatid growth and individualization, and regulation of spermatogonial divisions; Belongs to the dynein light chain family",
    "annotationB": "Protein spindle-F; Plays a role in oocyte axis determination and microtubule organization during oogenesis. Also required for polarized organization of the bristle. Required, with jvl, for activation of the kinase IKKepsilon in the germ line. Also required for localization of IKKepsilon to the distal tip of elongating bristles by acting as an adapter linking IKKepsilon and cytoplasmic dynein. Involved in dendrite pruning in larval sensory neurons during metamorphosis",
