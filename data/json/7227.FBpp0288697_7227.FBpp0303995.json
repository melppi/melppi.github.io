The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein Hippo (Hpo), in complex with its regulatory protein Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts) in complex with its regulatory protein Mats, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein. The Hippo/ [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Myc protein; Participates in the regulation of gene transcription. Binds DNA in a non-specific manner, yet also specifically recognizes the core sequence CAC[GA]TG. Seems to activate the transcription of growth-related genes; required for cellular proliferation and growth. Functions in the TORC2- mediated regulation of cell growth, acting downstream of the TORC2 complex. Inhibits the demethylase activity of Lid. Activates transcription of mbm. Able to induce the SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase member archipelago (ago) which functions in its degradation. It may therefore create a negati [...] ",
