    "annotationA": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D-2; mRNA cap-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is involved in protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs and, together with other initiation factors, stimulates binding of mRNA and methionyl-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation. In the eIF-3 complex, eif3d specifically recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine cap of a subset of mRNAs",
