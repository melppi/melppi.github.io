    "annotationA": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-A; Cyclin A (CycA) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",
    "annotationB": "RE72064p; Mad2 is a conserved component of the spindle checkpoint. During mitosis, it is recruited to unattached kinetochores, where it binds Mad1 and fzy, promoting the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex. During interphase, Mad2 is intranuclear, bound to Mad1, and associated primarily with the nuclear pore complex",
