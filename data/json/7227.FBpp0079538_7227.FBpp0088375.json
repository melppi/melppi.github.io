Rel-p68 subunit translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the promoter of the Cecropin A1 gene and probably other antimicrobial peptide genes. I-kappa-B kinase complex (ird5 and key) and PGRP-LC are essential signaling components in transmitting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal leading to cact degradation for NF-kappa-B (rel) activation. Part of a Toll-related receptor pathway that functions in the apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition. May be part of a NF- kappa-B and Tollo signa [...] ",
