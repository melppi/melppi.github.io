    "annotationA": "Autophagy protein 5; Involved in autophagic vesicle formation. Conjugation with Atg12, through a ubiquitin-like conjugating system involving Atg7 as an E1-like activating enzyme and Atg10 as an E2-like conjugating enzyme, is essential for its function. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate acts as an E3-like enzyme which is required for lipidation of Atg8 and its association to the vesicle membranes (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein; UV-resistance associated gene (Uvrag) regulates autophagy and vesicle trafficking with Atg6 and class C vaculoar protein sorting complexes. With Atg6 and Pi3K59F, Uvrag forms a PI3K(III) complex and plays roles in receptor downregulation and the establishment of proper cell polarity. It is also critical for proper organ rotation during development by controlling receptor endocytosis and subsequent degradation",
