It is involved in the biological process described with: positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway; regulation of post-mating oviposition; reproduction; positive regulation of Wnt protein secretion; Golgi vesicle transport; neurogenesis",
    "annotationB": "Protein Wnt-5; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Probable developmental protein. May be a signaling molecule which affects the development of discrete regions of tissues. Is likely to signal over only few cell diameters. May have a role in limb and CNS development; may be a downstream target of Dll that acts in the specification of these primordia; Belongs to the Wnt family",
