    "annotationA": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; mRNA-binding protein involved in translation elongation. Has an important function at the level of mRNA turnover, probably acting downstream of decapping. Involved in actin dynamics and cell cycle progression, mRNA decay and probably in a pathway involved in stress response and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Functions as a regulator of apoptosis; Belongs to the eIF-5A family",
    "annotationB": "60S ribosomal protein L8; Structural constituent of ribosome. It is involved in the biological process described with: regulation of cell size; insulin receptor signaling pathway; mitotic spindle elongation; translation; compound eye development; centrosome duplication; mitotic spindle organization",
