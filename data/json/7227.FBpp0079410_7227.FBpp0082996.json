Cytoplasmic dynein acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. Required for spermatid differentiation. Is not required for polarized transport in rhabdomere development and appears to be a non-essential component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex",
