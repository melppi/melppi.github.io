Transfers glucose from dolichyl phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol (By similarity). Functions in developmental processes such as germband extension, the apical constriction of mesoderm precursor cells and ventral furrow formation in early embryogenesis prior to gastrulation. Involved in the glycosylation and intracellular distribution of shg ( [...] ",
