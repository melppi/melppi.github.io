Med can bind its siblings Mad or Smox to facilitate signal transduction for dpp or Activin ligands in the TGF-beta family. Med-complexes function as transcriptional regulators. Many developmental roles include dorsal-ventral patterning, patterning and proliferation of the wing disc and gene expression in the mushroom body of the larval brain",
