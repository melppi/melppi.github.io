May also be required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space (By similarity); Belongs to the small Tim family",
    "annotationB": "Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim10B; Component of the TIM22 complex, a complex that mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The TIM22 complex forms a twin- pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as the external driving force. In the TIM22 complex, it may act as a docking point for the soluble 70 kDa complex that guides the target proteins in transit through the aqueous mitochondrial intermembrane space (By similarity)",
