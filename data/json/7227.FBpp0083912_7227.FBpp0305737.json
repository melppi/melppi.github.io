TFIIA in a complex with TBP mediates transcriptional activity. Part of a rhi-dependent transcription machinery that enables the generation of piRNA precursors from heterochromatin while maintaining the suppression of transposon-encoded promoters and enhancers. Forms a complex with Moonshiner/CG12721 and Trf2 which recruit transcriptional machinery to heterochromatin to initiate the bidirectional transcription  [...] ",

Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors (By similarity).
