May assist in the first step in the bypass of abasic lesions by the insertion of a nucleotide opposite the lesion. Required for normal induction of mutations by physical and chemical agents",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant 1A (Uev1A) is a conserved protein that contributes to ubiquitin protein ligase activity, but not catalytically, since it lacks the conserved cysteine residue essential for protein ubiquitination. Uev1A regulates genomic integrity, IMD pathway-mediated innate immunity, JNK-pathway mediated cell death and tumor invasion",
