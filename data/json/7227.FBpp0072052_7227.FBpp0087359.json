The G(s) protein is involved in hormonal regulation of adenylate cyclase: it activates the cyclase (By similarity); Belongs to the G-alpha family. G(s) subfamily",
    "annotationB": "G protein alpha o subunit (Galphao) is the most abundant G protein in the nervous tissue and is involved in signaling by a variety of GPCRs. Galphao functions include heart development, axonogenesis, neuro-muscular junction formation, asymmetric cell division, planar cell polarity, blood-brain barrier establishment, Wnt signaling, and gustatory and olfactory sensory perception; Belongs to the G-alpha family.
