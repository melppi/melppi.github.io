Catalyzes the hydrolysis of dead-end complexes between DNA and the topoisomerase I active site tyrosine residue. Hydrolyzes 3'-phosphoglycolates on protruding 3' ends on DNA double-strand breaks due to DNA damage by radiation and free radicals. Acts on blunt-ended double-strand DNA breaks and on single-stranded DNA. May have low 3'exonuclease activity and may be able to remove a sing [...] ",
