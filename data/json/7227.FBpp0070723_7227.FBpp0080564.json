    "annotationA": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk) is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity depends on the regulatory CycH and Mat1 subunits. This trimeric Cdk complex activates other Cdks by phosphorylation in their T-loop and is called Cdk activating kinase (CAK). CAK can also be part of TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates different transcription substrates (e.g. CTD of Pol II)",
    "annotationB": "DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB11; DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB11 is part of the core element with the central large cleft (By similarity)",
