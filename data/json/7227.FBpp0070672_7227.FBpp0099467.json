It homodimerizes and binds to a variety of proteins. It is involved in both dynein-dependent and independent functions such as cell viability, axonal guidance, spermatid growth and individualization, and regulation of spermatogonial divisions; Belongs to the dynein light chain family",
    "annotationB": "Protein kibra; Regulator of the Hippo/SWH (Sav/Wts/Hpo) signaling pathway, a signaling pathway that plays a pivotal role in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein Hippo (Hpo), in complex with its regulatory protein Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts) in complex with its regulatory protein Mats, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein. Kibra acts synergistically along with Ex and Mer to regulate the Hippo signalin [...] ",
