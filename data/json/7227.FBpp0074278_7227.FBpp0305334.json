It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway; negative regulation of growth of symbiont in host; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity; actin cytoskeleton organization; autophagic vacuole fusion; intracellular protein transport",

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins (By similarity).
