    "annotationA": "Regulator of gene activity; Component of the CCR4-NOT complex which is one of the major cellular mRNA deadenylases and is linked to various cellular processes including bulk mRNA degradation, miRNA-mediated repression, translational repression during translational initiation and general transcription regulation. Additional complex functions may be a consequence of its influence on mRNA expression. Essential for viability. Acts as a suppressor of position effect variegation (PEV) at the white locus and regulates the expression of several unrelated genes",
    "annotationB": "Pop2, isoform E; Protein binding; poly(A)-specific ribonuclease activity; nucleic acid binding. It is involved in the biological process described with: mRNA catabolic process; neuron development; muscle organ development; regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter; mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint; neurogenesis; nuclear-transcribed mRNA poly(A) tail shortening; negative regulation of translation",
