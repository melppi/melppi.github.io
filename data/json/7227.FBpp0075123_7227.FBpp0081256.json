    "annotationA": "Female-specific protein transformer; Member of the regulatory pathway controlling female somatic sexual differentiation, regulated by Sxl. Activates dsx female-specific splicing by promoting the formation of a splicing enhancer complex which consists of tra, tra2 and sr proteins. Together with tra-2, plays a role in switching fru splicing from the male-specific pattern to the female-specific pattern through activation of the female-specific fru 5'-splice site. No known function in males",
    "annotationB": "Protein doublesex; Controls somatic sexual differentiation. Binds directly and specifically to the FBE (fat body enhancer) of the yolk protein 1 and 2 genes (Yp1 and Yp2). This enhancer is sufficient to direct the female-specific transcription characteristic of the Yp genes in adult fat bodies. Involved in regulation of male- specific expression of takeout in brain-associated fat body",
