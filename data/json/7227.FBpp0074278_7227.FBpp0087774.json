    "annotationA": "Vacuolar protein sorting 4, isoform A; ATP binding; ATPase activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway; negative regulation of growth of symbiont in host; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity; actin cytoskeleton organization; autophagic vacuole fusion; intracellular protein transport",
    "annotationB": "Vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 25; Component of the ESCRT-II complex (ensodomal sorting complex required for transport II), which is required for multivesicular body (MVB) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity). Seems to function as a tumor suppressor by regulating Notch trafficking, hence preventing non-autonomous overproliferation. May be invo [...] ",
