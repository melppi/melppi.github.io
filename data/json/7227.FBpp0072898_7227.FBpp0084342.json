Methylation is not dependent on the nature of the nucleoside 5' of the target nucleoside. This is the first step in the biosynthesis of wybutosine (yW), a modified base adjacent to the anticodon of tRNAs and required for accurate decoding; Belongs to the class I-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily.
