    "annotationA": "Moesin/ezrin/radixin homolog 1; Involved in connections of major cytoskeletal structures to the plasma membrane. Together with wgn, involved in control of axon targeting of R8 and R2-R5 photoreceptors, independent of egr. In the nucleus, recruited to sites of active transcription by RNA polymerase II where it has a role in nuclear mRNA export together with the mRNA export factor PCID2 and other messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles",
    "annotationB": "Protein limb expression 1 homolog; Component of the Fat (ft) signaling pathway that functions in normal development of various organs such as the wing and leg. In developing imaginal disks, involved in regulating both the protein levels and apical localization of ft and ds. Involved in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) along the anterior- posterior axis of the wing (the early Fz signaling event), probably by acting upstream of ds and ft to regulate Fz activity",
