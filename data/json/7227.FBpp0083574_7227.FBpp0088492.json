    "annotationA": "Fas-associated death domain protein; Component of the IMD signaling pathway and is required for the host defense against Gram-negative bacteria. Interacts with Dredd, promotes cleavage of Dredd and is necessary and sufficient for enhancing Dredd-induced apoptosis",
    "annotationB": "Peptidoglycan-recognition protein LC; Major activator of the imd/Relish pathway and is likely to encode a pattern recognition molecule for the humoral immune response. Required for Relish processing and nuclear translocation following proteolytic cleavage. Involved in the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan of Gram-negative bacteria. The different isoforms probably display different recognition capabilities to various microbial patterns; Belongs to the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase 2 family",
