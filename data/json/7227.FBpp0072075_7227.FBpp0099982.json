Acts as a negative regulator of the BMP (Dpp) signaling cascade during crossvein development in pupal wings and possibly during synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Appears to be required for pupal development and consequently transition to the adult stage. During pupal development, plays essential and redundant functions with the other LEM domain proteins; bocks and Ote",
    "annotationB": "LEM domain-containing protein Bocksbeutel; Inner nuclear membrane protein. May have a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear lamina. During pupal development, plays essential and redundant functions with the other LEM domain proteins; MAN1 and Ote. Also has a redundant but important role with Ote in larval development",
