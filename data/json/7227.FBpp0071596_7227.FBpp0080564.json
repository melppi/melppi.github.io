    "annotationA": "TATA binding protein is a basal transcription factor required at most RNA Pol I and Pol II-transcribed genes in Drosophila. Traditionally thought to be recruited only to TATA box containing promoters, recent work shows that promoters with very weak TATA box consensus sequences also recruit TBP as a part of the multisubunit TFIID basal transcription factor or via the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex",
    "annotationB": "DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB11; DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB11 is part of the core element with the central large cleft (By similarity)",
