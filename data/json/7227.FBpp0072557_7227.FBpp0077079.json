It is involved in the biological process described with: regulation of endosome size; positive regulation of protein ubiquitination; eye-antennal disc development; regulation of Rab protein signal transduction; imaginal disc-derived wing vein specification; negative regulation of multicellular organism growth",
    "annotationB": "Monensin sensitivity 1 (Mon1) forms a complex with Ccz1 and acts as an exchange factor of the small G-protein Rab7. Mon1 activates and recruits Rab7 to the maturing endosome, where Rab7 organizes the fusion of the matured endosome with the lysosome. Mon1/Ccz1 complex loss of function results in Rab7 phenotypes",
