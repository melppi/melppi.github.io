    "annotationA": "COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5; Probable protease subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has no metalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunits of  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 catalytic subunit; Catalytic subunit of the dimeric Uba3-APP-BP1 E1 enzyme. E1 activates Nedd8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a Nedd8-Uba3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers Nedd8 to the catalytic cysteine of Ubc12. Required for Cul1 and Cul3 neddylation. Negatively regulates full-length ci stability and hedgehog signaling",
