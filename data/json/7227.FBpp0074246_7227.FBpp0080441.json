May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles. May phosphorylate the CDC25 phosphatase stg, which promotes its degradation. This results in increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk1-cyclin complexes and consequent inhibition of cell cycle progression",
