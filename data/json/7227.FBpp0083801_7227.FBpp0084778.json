At the endoplasmic reticulum, SEC13 is involved in the biogenesis of COPII-coated vesicles (By similarity). Recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin at the time of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Required for proper expression of ecdysone-responsive genes such as Eip74EF and Eip75B during larval development. Required for reactivation of transcription after heat shock. Required for nuclear import of phosphorylated Mad via importin msk. Has no role i [...] ",
