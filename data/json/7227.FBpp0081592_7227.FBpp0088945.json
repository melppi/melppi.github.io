It is involved in the biological process described with: vesicle coating; synaptic vesicle coating; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; vesicle-mediated transport; intracellular transport; negative regulation of endocytic recycling; compound eye development; secretory granule organization; intracellular protein transport; neurotransmitter secretion; Belongs to the adaptor complexes medium subunit family",
    "annotationB": "AP-2 complex subunit alpha; Adaptins are components of the adapter complexes which link clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles. Clathrin-associated protein complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. AP-2alpha is a subunit of the plasma membrane adapter",
