In non-neuronal cells wls directs wg secretion. The wls traffic loop encompasses the Golgi, the cell surface, an endocytic compartment and a retrograde route leading back to the Golgi, and involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the retromer complex (a conserved protein complex consisting of Vps35 and Vps26). In neuronal cells (the larval motorneuron NMJ), the wg signal moves across the synapse via the release of wls- containing ex [...] ",
