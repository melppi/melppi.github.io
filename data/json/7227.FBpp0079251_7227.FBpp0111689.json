H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting Su(var)205/HP1 to methylated histones. Plays a central role during oogenesis; Belongs to the class V-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily. Histone-lysine methyltransferase family. Suvar3-9 subfamily",
