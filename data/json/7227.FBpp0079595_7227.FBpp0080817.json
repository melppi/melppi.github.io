Transfers glucose from dolichyl phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol. Involved in cuticle differentiation",
    "annotationB": "Probable dolichol-phosphate mannosyltransferase; Transfers mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol monophosphate to form dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) which is the mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane anchoring, and O- mannosylation of proteins; Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family",
