    "annotationB": "Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2; Transcription factor that could be a key player in early mesoderm differentiation and may be required for subsequent cell fate specifications within the somatic and visceral/heart mesodermal layers. Essential for myoblast fusion and consequently muscle formation in adults. During embryonic and pupal development, binds to the enhancer of the myoblast fusion gene sing and activates its transcription; Belongs to the MEF2 family",
