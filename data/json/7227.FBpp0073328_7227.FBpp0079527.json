    "annotationA": "GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran; GTPase involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, participating both to the import and the export from the nucleus of proteins and RNAs. Switches between a cytoplasmic GDP- and a nuclear GTP-bound state by nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Nuclear import receptors such as importin beta bind their substrates only in the absence of GTP-bound Ran and release them upon direct interaction with GTP-bound Ran while export receptors behave in the opposite way. Thereby, RAN controls cargo loading and release by transport receptors in the proper compartment a [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Importin subunit alpha; Pendulin (Pen) is a member of the Importin-alpha protein family, an essential adaptor in the Ran-GTP nuclear transport cycle binding a cargo protein to the nuclear import receptor Fs(2)Ket. In addition to nuclear protein import, Pendulin is involved in centrosome duplication, mitotic spindle dynamics, nuclear envelope assembly, ring canal formation in the female germline, geotaxic behaviour and perception of pain",
