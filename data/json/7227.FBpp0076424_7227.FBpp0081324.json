It is a component of the eIF4F cap-binding complex that is essential for cap-dependent translation of mRNA. eIF4E-3 is primarily expressed in testes and is required for male fertility, but not for viability",
    "annotationB": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III; ATP-dependent RNA helicase. Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. Involved in exon definition of genes containing long introns, including the rolled/MAPK gene. Has a role in oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the developing oocyte",
