    "annotationA": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; mRNA-binding protein involved in translation elongation. Has an important function at the level of mRNA turnover, probably acting downstream of decapping. Involved in actin dynamics and cell cycle progression, mRNA decay and probably in a pathway involved in stress response and maintenance of cell wall integrity. Functions as a regulator of apoptosis; Belongs to the eIF-5A family",
    "annotationB": "Elongation factor 1-gamma; Ef1gamma associates with other EF1 subunits (alpha/beta/delta). It binds tubulin and Doa protein kinase, which in turns phosphorylates Ef1gamma. Ef1gamma regulates organelle movement along microtubules",
