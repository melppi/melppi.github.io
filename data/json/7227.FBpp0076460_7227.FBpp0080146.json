Seems to contact the pointed end of the daughter actin filament (By similarity). Required during embryogenesis for the developmental migration of tail hemocytes anteriorly, along the ventral midline",
    "annotationB": "Actin-related protein 2/3 complex, subunit 1 (Arpc1) is one of seven components of the highly conserved Arp2/3 complex. The Arp2/3 complex is required for many cellular and developmental processes requiring F-actin polymerization, including germline ring canal growth, embryonic cellularization, myoblast fusion, and endocytosis",
