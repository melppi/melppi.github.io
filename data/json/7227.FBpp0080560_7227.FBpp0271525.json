    "annotationA": "Embryonic polarity protein dorsal; Embryonic developmental protein. The lateral or ventral identity of a cell depends upon the concentration of this protein in its nucleus during the blastoderm stage. A morphogenetic protein that specifically binds to the kappa B-related consensus sequence 5'-GRGAAAANCC-3', located in the enhancer region of zygotic genes such as Zen, Twist, Snail and Decapentaplegic. Mediates an immune response in larvae. Part of a signaling pathway involving NF-kappa-B and Toll-related receptors, that functions in the apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition.  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Protein Tube; Plays an essential role in the Tl receptor signaling pathway that establishes embryonic dorsoventral polarity; the signal directs import of dl into ventral and ventrolateral nuclei, thereby establishing dorsoventral polarity. Tub recruits pll to the plasma membrane and protein-protein interaction activates pll. Also has a role in pupal pattern formation",
