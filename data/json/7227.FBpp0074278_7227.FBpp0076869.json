It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway; negative regulation of growth of symbiont in host; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity; actin cytoskeleton organization; autophagic vacuole fusion; intracellular protein transport",
    "annotationB": "Charged multivesicular body protein 2b (CHMP2B) is an ESCRT-III component. It plays an important role in the generation of multivesicular bodies in the endosomal lysosomal pathway. CHMP2B is also considered to play an important role in autophagosome maturation; Belongs to the SNF7 family",
