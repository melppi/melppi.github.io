    "annotationA": "Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (Bace) is an aspartic protease that cleaves amyloid precursor proteins. In humans, Bace, together with the gamma-secretase complex, generates the toxic Abeta peptide that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Drosophila Bace contributes to glial cell survival and enhances neuronal degeneration caused by expression of Appl; Belongs to the peptidase A1 family",
    "annotationB": "Serine protease inhibitor 88Ea; Serine protease inhibitor with activity toward trypsin. Negatively regulates the Toll signaling pathway and suppresses the expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin. Its negative regulation of the Toll signaling pathway also results in the inhibition of the melanization immune response via the phenoloxidase (PPO1) cascade. Essential for unfolding and expansion of the wings after emergence from the pupal case. May regulate the Toll pathway by blocking the proteolysis of the Toll ligand spz",
