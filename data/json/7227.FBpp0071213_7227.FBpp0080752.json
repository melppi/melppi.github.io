Together with wgn, involved in control of axon targeting of R8 and R2-R5 photoreceptors, independent of egr. In the nucleus, recruited to sites of active transcription by RNA polymerase II where it has a role in nuclear mRNA export together with the mRNA export factor PCID2 and other messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles",
    "annotationB": "Paxillin, isoform F; Paxillin (Pax) is an adaptor protein that is generally associated with integrins. It is not required for most integrin-mediated adhesion or migration events, but is required for viability beyond pupal stages. Pax controls the size of some muscles by regulating the rate of cell fusion",
