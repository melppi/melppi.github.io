It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Structural maintenance of chromosomes 5, isoform E; SUMO ligase activity; damaged DNA binding; ATPase activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: mitotic nuclear division; cellular response to DNA damage stimulus; mitotic sister chromatid segregation; DNA repair; response to caffeine; double-strand break repair via homologous recombination",
