It is involved in the biological process described with: cell proliferation; neuron remodeling; regulation of programmed cell death; regulation of Ras protein signal transduction; regulation of growth; autophagy; mushroom body development; larval midgut cell programmed cell death; protein ubiquitination; lipid storage; Belongs to the ubiquitin-activating E1 family",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin-related modifier 1 homolog; Acts as a sulfur carrier required for 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of cytosolic tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Serves as sulfur donor in tRNA 2- thiolation reaction by being thiocarboxylated (-COSH) at its C- terminus by MOCS3. The sulfur is then transferred to tRNA to form 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U. Also acts as a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) that is covalently conjugated via an isopeptide bond to lysine residues of target proteins. The thiocarboxylated form serves as substrate for conjugation and oxidative stress sp [...] ",
