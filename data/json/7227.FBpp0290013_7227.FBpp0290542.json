    "annotationA": "Complexin is a presynaptic cytosolic protein that regulates SNARE complex assembly and fuction. It has both positive and negative roles in synaptic transmission, serving as the synaptic vesicle fusion clamp and as an activator of evoked release; Belongs to the complexin/synaphin family",
    "annotationB": "Peripheral plasma membrane protein CASK; CASK is a member of the MAGUK family of scaffolding proteins. In epithelial tissues, CASK functions as an adhesion molecule involved in cell proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration. In neurons, CASK serves as a scaffold for a number of signaling and transmembrane molecules and is involved in synaptic development and plasticity; In the N-terminal section; belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CAMK Ser/Thr protein kinase family. CaMK subfamily",
