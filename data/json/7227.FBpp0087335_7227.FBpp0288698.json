    "annotationA": "Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 5; TFIID is a multimeric protein complex that plays a central role in mediating promoter responses to various activators and repressors. May play a role in helping to anchor Taf4 within the TFIID complex. May be involved in transducing signals from various transcriptional regulators to the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery; Belongs to the WD repeat TAF5 family",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase nonstop; Histone deubiquitinating component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA. Catalyzes the deubiquitination of histone H2B, thereby acting as a coactivator in a large subset of genes. Required to counteract heterochromatin silencing. Controls the development of neuronal connectivity in visual system by being required for accurate axon targeting in the optic lobe. Required for expression of ecdysone-induced genes such as br/broad; Belongs to the peptidase C19 family. UBP8 subfamily",
