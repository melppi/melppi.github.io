It is involved in the biological process described with: regulation of cell size; insulin receptor signaling pathway; mitotic spindle elongation; translation; compound eye development; centrosome duplication; mitotic spindle organization",
    "annotationB": "Elongation factor 2; Catalyzes the GTP-dependent ribosomal translocation step during translation elongation. During this step, the ribosome changes from the pre-translocational (PRE) to the post- translocational (POST) state as the newly formed A-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA and P-site-bound deacylated tRNA move to the P and E sites, respectively. Catalyzes the coordinated movement of the two tRNA molecules, the mRNA and conformational changes in the ribosome (By similarity); Belongs to the TRAFAC class translation factor GTPase superfamily. Classic translation factor GTPase family. EF-G/E [...] ",
