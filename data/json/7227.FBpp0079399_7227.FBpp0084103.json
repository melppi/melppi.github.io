Probably functions redundantly with other cyclins in regulation of cell cycle. Its presence may be required to delay a deadline for completing cytokinesis that is ordinary imposed by nuclear envelope reformation. Degradation of CycB and CycB3 promote cytokinesis furrow initiation and ingression. Required with CycB for female fertility",
