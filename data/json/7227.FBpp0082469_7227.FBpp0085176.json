    "annotationA": "Cyclin-C; Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in regulated gene transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. Binds to and activates cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk8 that phosphorylate [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog; Medea (Med) belongs to the highly conserved Smad family. Med can bind its siblings Mad or Smox to facilitate signal transduction for dpp or Activin ligands in the TGF-beta family. Med-complexes function as transcriptional regulators. Many developmental roles include dorsal-ventral patterning, patterning and proliferation of the wing disc and gene expression in the mushroom body of the larval brain",
