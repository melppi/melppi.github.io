Involved the biosynthesis of the hypermodified N1-methyl-N3-(3- amino-3-carboxypropyl) pseudouridine (m1acp3-Psi) conserved in eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Has also an essential role in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis independent on its methyltransferase activity, facilitating the incorporation of ribosomal protein S19 during the formation of pre-ribosomes; Belongs to the class IV-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfamily [...] ",
