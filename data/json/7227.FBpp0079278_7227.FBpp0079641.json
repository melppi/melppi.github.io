    "annotationA": "Exportin-1; Receptor for the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). Binds cooperatively to the NES on its target protein and to the small GTPase Ran in its active GTP-bound form. Required for the function or maintenance of certain tissues such as brain and gut. Involved in the export of dl from the nucleus to the cytoplasm; Belongs to the exportin family",
    "annotationB": "Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) is a catalytic protein kinase subunit that can only become active after association with either CycA, CycB or CycB3. The protein kinase activities of these complexes (CycA-Cdk1, CycB-Cdk1, CycB3-Cdk1) control important aspects of progression through the cell cycle. Functionally, the different Cdk1 complexes are partially redundant. They phosphorylate hundreds of target proteins and are most important for progression into and through mitotic and meiotic M phases; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CMGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family. CDC2/CDKX subfamily",
