The ATPase activity of Orc1 is critical for the formation and function of the pre-replicative complex. The regulated degradation of Orc1 by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis after initiation of DNA replication helps to prevent re-replication",
    "annotationB": "Regulatory particle triple-A ATPase 4 (Rpt4) is the 19S proteasomal ATPase, which is a component of the 26S proteosome complex. Rpt4 localizes to the nucleolus and participates in regulating rRNA transcription. Rpt4 physically interacts with the BHD tumor suppressor",
