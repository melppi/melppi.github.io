    "annotationA": "Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein 1; Isoform Mocs1a and isoform Mocs1b probably form a complex that catalyzes the conversion of 5'-GTP to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Mocs1a catalyzes the cyclization of GTP to (8S)-3',8-cyclo-7,8-dihydroguanosine 5'- triphosphate and Mocs1b catalyzes the subsequent conversion of (8S)-3',8-cyclo-7,8-dihydroguanosine 5'-triphosphate to cPMP; In the C-terminal section; belongs to the MoaC family",
