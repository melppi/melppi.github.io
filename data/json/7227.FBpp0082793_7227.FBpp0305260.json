    "annotationA": "Homeotic protein ultrabithorax; Sequence-specific transcription factor which is part of a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior axis. Binds the consensus region 5'-TTAAT[GT][GA]-3'. This homeotic protein controls development of the cells in the posterior thoracic and first abdominal segments. It activates the synthesis of the decapentaplegic (DPP) growth factor; Belongs to the Antp homeobox family",
    "annotationB": "Transcription factor GAGA; Transcriptional activator that functions by regulating chromatin structure. Overcomes the repressive effects of chromatin by promoting the open chromatin conformation in promoter gene regions, thereby allowing access to other transcription factors. Binds to DNA Polycomb response elements (PREs) at the bithorax complex and to the proximal region of the engrailed promoter, and positively regulates transcription of many genes including homeotic ones. Binds to the DNA sequence (GA)n, with optimal binding to the pentamer 5'-GAGAG-3'. Binds DNA as an oligomer. May  [...] ",
