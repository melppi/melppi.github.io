Second largest component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB2 is  [...] ",

TFIIA in a complex with TBP mediates transcriptional activity. Part of a rhi-dependent transcription machinery that enables the generation of piRNA precursors from heterochromatin while maintaining the suppression of transposon-encoded promoters and enhancers. Forms a complex with Moonshiner/CG12721 and Trf2 which recruit transcriptional machinery to heterochromatin to initiate the bidirectional transcription  [...] ",
