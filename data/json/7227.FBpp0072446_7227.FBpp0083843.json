Through the RING-type zinc finger, seems to recruit the E2 ubiquitination enzyme to the complex and brings it into close proximity to the substrate (By similarity); Belongs to the RING-box family",

It is involved in the biological process described with: proteolysis; cellular process; protein catabolic process; proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process; Belongs to the AAA ATPase family",
