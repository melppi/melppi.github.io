    "annotationA": "Protein sister of odd and bowel; Pair-rule protein that determines both the size and polarity of even-numbered as well as odd-numbered parasegments during embryogenesis. DNA-binding transcription factor that acts primarily as a transcriptional repressor but can also function as a transcriptional activator, depending on the stage of development and spatial restrictions (By similarity). May function redundantly with odd and drm in leg joint formation during the larval stages, acting downstream of Notch activation",
    "annotationB": "Protein lines; Has a dual role as a segment polarity protein and as a modulator of the Abd-B protein. Required for Abd-B to activate the transcription of genes (including ems, cut and sal) that are involved in posterior spiracle morphogenesis. Also required for Abd-B to form an eighth abdominal denticle belt. Acts in a hierarchy downstream of drm and upstream of bowl during foregut and hindgut patterning and morphogenesis. Involved in cell rearrangement during elongation of the embryonic hindgut. Required to regulate expression of embryonic hindgut patterning genes in order to establis [...] ",
