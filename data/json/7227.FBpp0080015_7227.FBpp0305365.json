Mildly suppresses the heterochromatin- mediated silencing phenomenon known as position-effect variegation (PEV). Required for epigenetic silencing of the polycomb group proteins. Has histone H4 deacetylase activity in vitro. Required maternally for establishing proper segmentation of the embryo. Involved in sex determination. May be involved in the regulation of life span",
