    "annotationA": "Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1; Acts as a phosphoinositide 5- and phosphoinositide 6- phosphatase and regulates cellular levels of inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). Also acts as a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate 3- phosphatase, by mediating the dephosphorylation of 2,3- bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) to produce phospho-D-glycerate without formation of 3-phosphoglycerate (By similarity). Has a role in embryonic tracheal development where it localizes to the leading edge of actively migrating branches. In these leading cells, enhances formati [...] ",
