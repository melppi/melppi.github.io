The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity (By similarity); Belongs to the peptidase T1B family",
    "annotationB": "26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 11; Component of the lid subcomplex of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. In the complex, RPN6 is required for proteasome assembly (By similarity). May act as linker between 19S regulatory subunit and the 20S proteasome core",
