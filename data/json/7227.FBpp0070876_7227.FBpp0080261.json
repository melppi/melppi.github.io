    "annotationA": "Protein deltex; Regulator of Notch signaling, a signaling pathway involved in cell-cell communications that regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate determinations. Mainly acts as a positive regulator of Notch, but it may also act as a negative regulator, depending on the developmental and cell context. Mediates the antineural activity of Notch. May function as a ubiquitin ligase protein in the Notch pathway; Belongs to the Deltex family",
    "annotationB": "Suppressor of hairless protein; Transcriptional regulator that plays a central role in Notch signaling, a signaling pathway involved in cell-cell communication that regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate determinations. Binds directly the 5'-GTGRGAR-3' DNA consensus sequence, which is present in the regulatory region of several genes. Required for neurogenesis in imaginal disks. Acts as a transcriptional repressor when it is not associated with Notch proteins. When associated with some Notch protein, it acts as a transcriptional activator that activates transcription of Notch target g [...] ",
