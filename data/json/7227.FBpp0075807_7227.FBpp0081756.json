The CycA-Cdk1 complex controls important aspects of progression through the cell cycle, including entry into mitosis. During the G2 phase, this complex is important for prevention of premature DNA re-replication. During mitosis and G1, CycA is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity",

The active ATPase sites in the Mcm2-7 ring are formed through the interaction surfaces of two neighboring subunits such that a critical structure of a conserved arginine finger motif is provided in trans relative to the ATP-binding site of the Walker A box of the adjacent subunit. The six ATPase active sites, however, are likely to contribute differential [...] ",
