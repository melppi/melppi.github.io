    "annotationA": "Protein aubergine; Acts via the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons. Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. In ovary, associates predominantly with antisense piRNAs that contain uridine at their 5' end. In testis, associates with  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Mitochondrial cardiolipin hydrolase; Cardiolipin hydrolase present at the mitochondrial outer membrane required for piRNA metabolic process. Acts by catalyzing the hydrolysis of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) to form phosphatidate (phosphatidic acid or PA) at the mitochondrial outer membrane surface, promoting the piRNA metabolic process. Plays a key role in primary biogenesis of piRNAs and is required during oogenesis to repress transposable elements and prevent their mobilization. piRNAs mediate the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes compose [...] ",
