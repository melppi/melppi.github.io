It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway; negative regulation of growth of symbiont in host; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity; actin cytoskeleton organization; autophagic vacuole fusion; intracellular protein transport",
    "annotationB": "Vacuolar-sorting protein SNF8; Larsen (Lsn), also known as Vacuolar protein sorting 22, is a member of the ESCRT-II complex, which sorts certain endocytosed receptors for degradation via the multivesicular body. As part of this complex, Lsn also has a role in bcd RNA localization",
