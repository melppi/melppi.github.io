The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation",

It is involved in the biological process described with: translational elongation; translation; neurogenesis; maturation of SSU-rRNA from tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA); Belongs to the eukaryotic ribosomal protein eS8 family",
