May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles. May phosphorylate the CDC25 phosphatase stg, which promotes its degradation. This results in increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk1-cyclin complexes and consequent inhibition of cell cycle progression",

Acts synergistically with Rbf2 to antagonize E2f1-mediated transcriptional activation. Component of the DREAM complex, a multiprotein complex that can both act as a transcription activator or repressor depending on the context. The DREAM complex is required for recruiting E2f2 at differentiation-specific promoters and for stabilizing E2f2-Rbf complexes during S phase. During development, the complex represses trans [...] ",
