May also negatively regulate cell cycle progression during unperturbed cell cycles. May phosphorylate the CDC25 phosphatase stg, which promotes its degradation. This results in increased inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk1-cyclin complexes and consequent inhibition of cell cycle progression",

Also exhibits endonuclease activity against 5'-overhanging flap structures similar to those generated by displacement synthesis when DNA polymerase encounters the 5'-end of a downstream Okazaki fragment. Required for DNA mismatch repair (MMR) (By similarity)",
