Required in dopaminergic (DA) neurons that innervate the mushroom body for satiety to suppress appetitive memory performance; a key factor in the internal state of hunger in the brain. NPF neurons coordinately modulate diverse sensory and motor neurons important for feeding, flight, and locomotion. NPF/NPFR pathway exerts its suppressive effect on larval aversion to d [...] ",
