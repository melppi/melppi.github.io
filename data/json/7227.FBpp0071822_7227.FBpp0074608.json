During late metaphase of mitosis and continuing in G1, CycB is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity, and allowing termination of mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Serine/threonine-protein kinase polo; May play a role in regulating both nuclear and cytoplasmic aspects of the mitotic cycle. Regulates localization of the augmin complex during mitosis by ensuring its location on mitotic spindles. Also regulates augmin complex localization during male meiosis by promoting its placement at kinetochores while preventing its association with spindle microtubules",
