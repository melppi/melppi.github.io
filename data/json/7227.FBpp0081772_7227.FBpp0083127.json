While in many cases methionine oxidation is the result of random oxidation following oxidative stress, methionine oxidation is also a post- translational modification that takes place on specific residues. Acts as a regulator of actin assembly by reducing methionine (R)- sulfoxide mediated by Mical on actin thereby promoting filament repolymerization",
