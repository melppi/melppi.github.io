    "annotationA": "AMPKalpha is the alpha subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. In general AMPK helps cells conserve energy through inhibition of energy consuming processes (fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis). AMPK is usually active when the TOR pathway is inhibited",
    "annotationB": "GTP-binding protein Rheb homolog; Binds GTP and exhibits intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). Activates the protein kinase activity of TORC1, and thereby plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Stimulates the phosphorylation of S6K through activation of TORC1 signaling. May also have a role in activating TORC2 signaling",
