    "annotationA": "Nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1; Component of the cap-binding complex (CBC), which binds cotranscriptionally to the 5'-cap of pre-mRNAs and is involved in various processes such as pre-mRNA splicing and RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi). The CBC complex is involved in miRNA-mediated RNA interference via its interaction with Ars2 and is required for primary microRNAs (miRNAs) processing. Also involved in innate immunity via the short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processing machinery by restricting the viral RNA production. In the CBC complex, Cbp80 does not bind directly capped RNAs [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Polyadenylate-binding protein 2; Involved in the 3'-end formation of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA) by the addition of a poly(A) tail of 200-250 nt to the upstream cleavage product. Stimulates poly(A) polymerase (PAPOLA) conferring processivity on the poly(A) tail elongation reaction and controls also the poly(A) tail length (By similarity). Increases the affinity of poly(A) polymerase for RNA (By similarity). Binds to poly(A) and to poly(G) with high affinity. May protect the poly(A) tail from degradation (By similarity). Plays a role in the positive regulation of alpha-1,3 fucosylation,  [...] ",
