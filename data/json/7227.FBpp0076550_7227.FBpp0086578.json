Has several distinct roles in protecting genome stability by resolving diverse forms of deleterious DNA structures originating from replication and recombination intermediates and from DNA damage (By similarity). Component of the SLX1-SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease that resolves DNA secondary structures generated during DNA repair and recombination. Has endonuclease activity towards branched DNA substrates, introducing sing [...] ",

The mei-9-Ercc1 heterodimer interacts with mus312 to make meiotic crossovers. Ercc1 functions include repair of UV-induced DNA damage, repair of base adducts, a backup pathway for mismatch repair and meiotic recombination",
