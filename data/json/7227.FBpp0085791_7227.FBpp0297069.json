    "annotationB": "Division abnormally delayed (Dally) is a core protein of heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the glypican family. It acts as a co-receptor for growth factors and morphogens, such as FGFs, dpp, wg, hh and upd1, and affects signaling and distribution of these ligands. Dally's roles include wing development and germline stem cell maintenance",
