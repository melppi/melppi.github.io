    "annotationA": "Homeobox protein homothorax; All isoforms are required for patterning of the embryonic cuticle. Acts with exd to delimit the eye field and prevent inappropriate eye development. Isoforms that carry the homeodomain are required for proper localization of chordotonal organs within the peripheral nervous system and antennal identity; required to activate antennal-specific genes, such as sal and to repress the leg-like expression of dac. Necessary for the nuclear localization of the essential HOX cofactor, extradenticle (exd). Both necessary and sufficient for inner photoreceptors to adopt [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Protein teashirt; Homeotic protein that acts downstream of Arm in the Wg cascade during embryogenesis to determine segment identity throughout the entire trunk. Acts cooperatively with other trunk homeotic proteins to repress head homeotic genes and therefore repress head segmental identity. Necessary, in combination with Scr, for the formation of the prothoracic segment. Promotes eye development in the dorsal region of the eye disk and suppresses eye development in the ventral region in combination with Wg- signaling and several early dorso-ventral eye patterning genes.
