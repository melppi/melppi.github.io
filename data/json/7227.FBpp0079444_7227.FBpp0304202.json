It is also required for normal eye patterning and for mitotic divisions in the ovary. Required for ovarian germ line stem cell self-renewal. May play a role in regulating translation. May function in recognizing stalled ribosomes and triggering endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, a mechanism to release non- functional ribosomes and degrade damaged mRNAs. May have ribonuclease activity (Potential)",
