Acts by directing the binding of methionyl-tRNAi to 40S ribosomal subunits. In contrast to the eIF- 2 complex, it binds methionyl-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a codon- dependent manner, whereas the eIF-2 complex binds methionyl-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a GTP-dependent manner. May act by impiging the expression of specific proteins (By similarity)",
