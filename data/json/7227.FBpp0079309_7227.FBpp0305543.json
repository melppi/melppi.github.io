    "annotationA": "Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (Bace) is an aspartic protease that cleaves amyloid precursor proteins. In humans, Bace, together with the gamma-secretase complex, generates the toxic Abeta peptide that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Drosophila Bace contributes to glial cell survival and enhances neuronal degeneration caused by expression of Appl; Belongs to the peptidase A1 family",
    "annotationB": "Serine protease inhibitor 27A; Serine protease inhibitor that functions in embryonic dorsoventral patterning and the melanization immune response. Regulates dorsoventral axis formation during early development by inhibiting the serine protease easter, and is therefore important for restricting activity of the Toll signaling pathway to the ventral part of the embryo. Also plays an essential role in the melanization immune response to both physical wounding and septic infection using certain bacteria and fungi. Negatively regulates the Hayan-dependent prophenoloxidase 1 (PPO1)-activating [...] ",
