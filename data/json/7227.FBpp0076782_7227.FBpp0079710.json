    "annotationA": "Regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (Rcc1) is the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Ran. It promotes the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of specific proteins and regulates chromatin condensation. Rcc1 roles include cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, epigenetic regulation, and neuronal specification",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore complex protein Nup107; Plays a role in nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly and maintenance. Required for nuclear import of Mad. Plays a role in double strand break repair by relocalizing the heterochromatic double strain breaks (DSBs) to the nuclear periphery as part of the homologous recombination (HR) repair process. Regulates cytokinesis during spermatocyte meiosis by maintaining type-B lamin Lam localization to the spindle envelope. Regulates female gonad development and oogenesis; Belongs to the nucleoporin Nup84/Nup107 family",
