As a reducing substrate of peroxiredoxin 1, thioredoxin 2 is preferred over thioredoxin 1. Required for female meiosis and early embryonic development",
    "annotationB": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B; Cyclin B (CycB) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The complex CycB-Cdk1 complex induces the start of mitosis. During late metaphase of mitosis and continuing in G1, CycB is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity, and allowing termination of mitosis",
