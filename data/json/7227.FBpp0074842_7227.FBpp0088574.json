As a component of the meiotic nuage, plays a central role during oogenesis by repressing transposable elements and preventing their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity. Repression of transposable elements is mediated via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the repression of transposons. As a nuclear component, it is required for proper differentiation in t [...] ",
