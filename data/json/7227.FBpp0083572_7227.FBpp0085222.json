    "annotationB": "Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase; Catalyzes the hydroxylation of the N(6)-(4-aminobutyl)- L-lysine intermediate to form hypusine, an essential post- translational modification only found in mature eIF-5A factor (By similarity). Essential for organismal viability and plays a role in a wide number of important processes such as cell growth and proliferation, and regulates induction of autophagy and protein synthesis. Has a role in eIF-5A-mediated translational control; Belongs to the deoxyhypusine hydroxylase family",
