    "annotationA": "5-demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, mitochondrial; Catalyzes the hydroxylation of 2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-6- methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (DMQH2) during ubiquinone biosynthesis. Has also a structural role in the COQ enzyme complex, stabilizing other COQ polypeptides. Involved in lifespan determination in a ubiquinone-independent manner",
    "annotationB": "4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase, mitochondrial; Catalyzes the prenylation of para-hydroxybenzoate (PHB) with an all-trans polyprenyl group. Mediates the second step in the final reaction sequence of coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, which is the condensation of the polyisoprenoid side chain with PHB, generating the first membrane-bound Q intermediate; Belongs to the UbiA prenyltransferase family",
