H4 'Lys-20' monomethylation is enriched during mitosis and represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. Mainly functions in euchromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the silencing of euchromatic genes. Required for cell proliferation, possibly by contributing to the maintenance of proper higher-order structure of DNA and chromosome condensation during mitosis; Belongs to the class V-like SAM-binding methyltransferase superfa [...] ",
