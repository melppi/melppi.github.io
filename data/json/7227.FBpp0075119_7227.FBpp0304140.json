Required for arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of en autoactivation. Negatively controls the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) growth in presynaptic motoneurons. Plays a role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and actin cytoskeleton during embryogenesis.
