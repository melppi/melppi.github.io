    "annotationA": "Ribosomal protein S3 (RpS3) is a component of the small subunit of cytoplasmic ribosomes, which translate mRNAs encoded by the nuclear genome. The gene is haploinsufficient - heterozygous mutants display the 'Minute' phenotype, characterized by a slower developmental rate and small adult bristles. RpS3 also contains a DNA lyase activity and functions in DNA repair",
    "annotationB": "Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocati [...] ",
