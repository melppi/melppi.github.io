The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity). ESCRT-II interacts, through the Vps36 subunit, with bicoid mRNA. This interaction is required for the anterior localization of bicoid m [...] ",
