As part of this complex, Lsn also has a role in bcd RNA localization",
    "annotationB": "Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; Essential role in endosome membrane invagination and formation of multivesicular bodies, MVBs. Required during gastrulation and appears to regulate early embryonic signaling pathways. Inhibits tyrosine kinase receptor signaling by promoting degradation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated, active receptor, potentially by sorting activated receptors into MVBs. The MVBs are then trafficked to the lysosome where their contents are degraded",
