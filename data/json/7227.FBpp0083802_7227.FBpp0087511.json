The gene is haploinsufficient - heterozygous mutants display the 'Minute' phenotype, characterized by a slower developmental rate and small adult bristles. RpS3 also contains a DNA lyase activity and functions in DNA repair",
    "annotationB": "Ribosome assembly factor mrt4; Component of the ribosome assembly machinery. Nuclear paralog of the ribosomal protein P0, it binds pre-60S subunits at an early stage of assembly in the nucleolus, and is replaced by P0 in cytoplasmic pre-60S subunits and mature 80S ribosomes",
