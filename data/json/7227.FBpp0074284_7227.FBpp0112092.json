Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates histone H2B. The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators, where it is required for transcription. Required for nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation. Binds independently on SAGA to promoters in an RNA-dependent manner. Binds [...] ",
