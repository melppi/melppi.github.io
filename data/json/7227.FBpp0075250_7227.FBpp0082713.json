Involved in the 3'-end processing of the U7 snRNA, and also the spliceosomal snRNAs U1 and U5. Plays a role as a regulator of spermatogenesis. Crucial regulator of the mitotic cell cycle and development. Required for the correct dynein-dynactin perinuclear localization important for nucleus-centrosome coupling that occur upon meiotic progression of primary spermatocytes. Plays a role in sperm motility and fertility. May have [...] ",
