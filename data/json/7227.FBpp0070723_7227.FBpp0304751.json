    "annotationA": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk) is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity depends on the regulatory CycH and Mat1 subunits. This trimeric Cdk complex activates other Cdks by phosphorylation in their T-loop and is called Cdk activating kinase (CAK). CAK can also be part of TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates different transcription substrates (e.g. CTD of Pol II)",
    "annotationB": "Transcription elongation factor S-II; Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase II transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by S-II allows the resumption of elongation from the new 3'-terminus",
