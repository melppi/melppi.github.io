    "annotationA": "Sex determination protein fruitless; Probably acts as a transcriptional regulator. Part of the somatic sex determination hierarchy; sex determination genes transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) switch fru splicing from the male-specific pattern to the female-specific pattern through activation of the female-specific fru 5'-splice site. Vital for the development of males and females. Controls the development of the male specific abdominal muscle of Lawrence. Plays a role in male courtship behavior and sexual orientation. Enhances male-specific expression of takeout in brain-associ [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Protein sex-lethal; Sex determination switch protein which controls sexual development by sex-specific splicing. Regulates dosage compensation in females by suppressing hyperactivation of X-linked genes. Expression of the embryo-specific isoform is under the control of primary sex-determining signal, which depends on the ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes (X:A ratio). Expression occurs in 2X:2A cells, but not in X:2A cells. The X:A ratio seems to be signaled by the relative concentration of the X- linked transcription factors SIS-A and SIS-B. As a result, the embryo-specific  [...] ",
