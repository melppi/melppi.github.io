    "annotationA": "Shadow (Sad) is a cytochrome P450 involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis. It shows a mitochondrial localization and catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to the 2 carbon of the cholesterol ring. Sad mutants fail to undergo head involution, dorsal closure or to secrete cuticle",

Involved in the metabolism of insect hormones; responsible for all ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity during embryonic, larval and adult stages. May be involved in the breakdown of synthetic insecticides; Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family",
