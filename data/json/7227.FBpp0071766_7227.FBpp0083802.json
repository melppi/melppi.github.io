    "annotationB": "Ribosomal protein S3 (RpS3) is a component of the small subunit of cytoplasmic ribosomes, which translate mRNAs encoded by the nuclear genome. The gene is haploinsufficient - heterozygous mutants display the 'Minute' phenotype, characterized by a slower developmental rate and small adult bristles. RpS3 also contains a DNA lyase activity and functions in DNA repair",
