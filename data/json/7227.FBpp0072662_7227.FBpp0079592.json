    "annotationA": "Patj is a PDZ domain-protein that forms an apical protein complex with crb and sdt. It plays supporting roles in apico-basal cell polarity and stability of adherens junction. It is also involved in retinal morphogenesis, maintenance, and planar cell polarity; Belongs to the Patj family",
    "annotationB": "Protein limb expression 1 homolog; Component of the Fat (ft) signaling pathway that functions in normal development of various organs such as the wing and leg. In developing imaginal disks, involved in regulating both the protein levels and apical localization of ft and ds. Involved in establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) along the anterior- posterior axis of the wing (the early Fz signaling event), probably by acting upstream of ds and ft to regulate Fz activity",
