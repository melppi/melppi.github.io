The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity). Seems to function as a tumor suppressor by regulating Notch trafficking, hence preventing non-autonomous overproliferation. May be invo [...] ",

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins (By similarity).
