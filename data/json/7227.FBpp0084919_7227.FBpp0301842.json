    "annotationA": "Axin (Axn) is the key scaffolding protein for the canonical Wnt signalling pathway. In the absence of signal, Axin targets arm for proteolysis inhibiting Wnt signalling. In the presence of signal, it forms a part of the membrane activation complex, disrupting arm degradation. This pathway play roles in cell proliferation (imaginal disc), differentiation (embryonic patterning), death and stemness",
    "annotationB": "Proteasome inhibitor PI31 subunit; Plays an important role in the control of proteasome function. Inhibits the hydrolysis of protein and peptide substrates by the 20S proteasome. Enhances 26S proteasome function by promoting its assembly through the interaction with the assembly chaperones PSMD9 and PMSD5. Functions together with ntc to control non-apoptotic caspase activation during sperm individualization. In testis, is required for proper protein degradation and germline cell cycle progression",
