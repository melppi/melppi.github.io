    "annotationB": "N-glycosylase/DNA lyase; DNA repair enzyme that incises DNA at 8-oxoG residues. Excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N- methylformamidopyrimidine (FAPY) from damaged DNA. Has a beta- lyase activity that nicks DNA 3' to the lesion. Efficiently incises DNA duplexes containing 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua), 8- hydroxyadenine (8-OH-Ade) and abasic (AP) sites placed opposite to a cytosine",
