It is involved in the biological process described with: regulation of cell cycle; negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter; negative regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle",
    "annotationB": "Transcription factor Dp; Component of the DREAM complex, a multiprotein complex that can both act as a transcription activator or repressor depending on the context. In follicle cells, the complex plays a central role in the site-specific DNA replication at the chorion loci. During development, the complex represses transcription of developmentally controlled E2F target genes. Can stimulate E2F- dependent transcription",
