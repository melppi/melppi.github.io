It is involved in the biological process described with: endoderm development; positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter; negative regulation of gene expression; antimicrobial humoral response; midgut development",
    "annotationB": "Fork head is a winged-helix nuclear transcription factor most studied for its role in salivary gland formation, where it is required for salivary gland viability, invagination, and maintaining expression of other early-expressed salivary gland transcription factors. It works with sage to activate expression of salivary gland specific gene products, such as secreted proteins and their modifying enzymes",
