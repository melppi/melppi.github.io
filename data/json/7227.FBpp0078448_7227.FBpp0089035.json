The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity (By similarity); Belongs to the peptidase T1B family",
    "annotationB": "Armadillo segment polarity protein; Isoform neural may associate with CadN and participate in the transmission of developmental information. Can associate with alpha-catenin. Isoform cytoplasmic accumulates through wg signaling; arm function in wg signal transduction is required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Arm and Abl proteins function cooperatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and epidermis; Belongs to the beta-catenin family",
