    "annotationA": "Transcriptional adapter 2B; Required for the function of some acidic activation domains, which activate transcription from a distant site. Binds double-stranded DNA. Binds dinucleosomes, probably at the linker region between neighboring nucleosomes. Plays a role in chromatin remodeling",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase nonstop; Histone deubiquitinating component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA. Catalyzes the deubiquitination of histone H2B, thereby acting as a coactivator in a large subset of genes. Required to counteract heterochromatin silencing. Controls the development of neuronal connectivity in visual system by being required for accurate axon targeting in the optic lobe. Required for expression of ecdysone-induced genes such as br/broad; Belongs to the peptidase C19 family. UBP8 subfamily",
