It is involved in the biological process described with: lysosome organization; ommochrome biosynthetic process; eye pigment biosynthetic process; vesicle coating; synaptic vesicle coating; compound eye pigmentation; vesicle-mediated transport; intracellular transport; intracellular protein transport; neurotransmitter secretion",
    "annotationB": "Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein LAP; Assembly protein recruiting clathrin and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) to cell membranes at sites of coated-pit formation and clathrin-vesicle assembly. May be required to determine the amount of membrane to be recycled, possibly by regulating the size of the clathrin cage. Involved in AP2-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction; Belongs to the PICALM/SNAP91 family",
