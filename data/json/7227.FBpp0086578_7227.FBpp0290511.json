The mei-9-Ercc1 heterodimer interacts with mus312 to make meiotic crossovers. Ercc1 functions include repair of UV-induced DNA damage, repair of base adducts, a backup pathway for mismatch repair and meiotic recombination",

Has endonuclease activity towards branched DNA substrates, introducing single-strand cuts in duplex DNA close to junctions with ss-DNA; Belongs to the SLX1 family",
