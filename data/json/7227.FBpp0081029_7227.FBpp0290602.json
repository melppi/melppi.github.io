Component of the DREAM complex, a multiprotein complex that can both act as a transcription activator or repressor depending on the context. The DREAM complex is required for recruiting E2f2 at differentiation-specific promoters and for stabilizing E2f2-Rbf complexes during S phase. During development, the complex represses trans [...] ",
