    "annotationA": "Serpin 77Bb; Serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: multicellular organism reproduction; negative regulation of endopeptidase activity; regulation of proteolysis; Belongs to the serpin family",
    "annotationB": "Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (Bace) is an aspartic protease that cleaves amyloid precursor proteins. In humans, Bace, together with the gamma-secretase complex, generates the toxic Abeta peptide that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Drosophila Bace contributes to glial cell survival and enhances neuronal degeneration caused by expression of Appl; Belongs to the peptidase A1 family",
