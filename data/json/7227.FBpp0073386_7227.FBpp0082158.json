Required for kinetochore integrity and the organization of stable microtubule binding sites in the outer plate of the kinetochore. Participates in SAC signaling that responds specifically to disruptions in spindle microtubule dynamics. The NDC80 complex synergistically enhances the affinity of the SKA1 complex for microtubules and may allow the NDC80 complex to track depolymerizing [...] ",
