Has a broad substrate specificity: able to acetylate the initiator methionine of most peptides (By similarity). Also displays N-epsilon-acetyltransferase activity by mediating acetylation of the side chain of specific lysines on proteins. Autoacetylates. Required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and couple the processes of cohesion and DNA replication to ensure that only sister chromatids become paired together [...] ",
