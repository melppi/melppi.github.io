    "annotationA": "Transcription elongation factor S-II; Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase II transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by S-II allows the resumption of elongation from the new 3'-terminus",
    "annotationB": "Probable DNA-directed RNA polymerases I and III subunit RPAC2; DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common core component of RNA polymerases I and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors and small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively (By similarity); Belongs to the archaeal RpoL/eukaryotic RPB11/RPC19 RNA polymerase subunit family",
