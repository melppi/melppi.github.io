It is an essential enzyme in the pathway for de novo synthesis of the purine nucleotide inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP is the precursor for purine nucleotides required for nucleic acids, energy transfer, cell signaling, and coenzymes; In the C-terminal section; belongs to the purine/pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase family",
