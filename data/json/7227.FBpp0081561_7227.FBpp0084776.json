    "annotationB": "Guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase MESH1; Metazoan SpoT homolog-1 is a structural and functional ortholog of bacterial protein SpoT. It hydrolyzes ppGpp to GDP. Its mutants show retarded growth in amino acid-starved media, suggesting the conserved role in stringent responses; Belongs to the MESH1 family",
