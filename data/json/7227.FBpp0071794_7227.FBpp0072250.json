    "annotationA": "ATP synthase subunit alpha, mitochondrial; Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Inorganic pyrophosphatase; Component of NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor), a complex which catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding and facilitates transcription of chromatin. NURF is required for homeotic gene expression, proper larval blood cell development, normal male X chromosome morphology, ecdysteroid signaling and metamorphosis. Nurf-38 may have adapted to deliver pyrophosphatase to chromatin to assist in replication or transcription by efficient removal of the inhibitory metabolite; Belongs to the PPase family",
