    "annotationA": "General transcription factor IIF subunit 1; TFIIF is a general transcription initiation factor that binds to RNA polymerase II and helps to recruit it to the initiation complex in collaboration with TFIIB. It promotes transcription elongation; Belongs to the TFIIF alpha subunit family",
    "annotationB": "Transcription elongation factor S-II; Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase II transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by S-II allows the resumption of elongation from the new 3'-terminus",
