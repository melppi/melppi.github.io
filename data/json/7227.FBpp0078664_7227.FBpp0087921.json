The 26S proteasome is involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The function of the 'Lys-63'-specific deubiquitination of the proteasome is unclear (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Cullin homolog 1; Core component of multiple SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which mediate the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. In the SCF complex, serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the SKP1-F-box protein and RBX1 subunits. May contribute to catalysis through positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. During early metamorphosis, part of the SCF-slmb complex that negatively regulates the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway to activate the pruning of unnecessary larva [...] ",
