As a reducing substrate of peroxiredoxin 1, thioredoxin 2 is preferred over thioredoxin 1. Required for female meiosis and early embryonic development",
    "annotationB": "Chorion peroxidase; Peroxinectin-like (Pxt) is a cycloxygenase-like enzyme that contributes to the synthesis of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins activate G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Pxt roles include oogenesis, sperm individualization, morphogenesis, nucleolar structure, temporal control of gene expression, and regulation of gene amplification; Belongs to the peroxidase family. XPO subfamily",
