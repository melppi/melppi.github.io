    "annotationA": "Borealin-related is one of the three targeting subunits for aurB kinase in the Chromosomal passenger complex. It helps to target the complex to the centromere region of chromosomes and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. At centromeres the complex is involved both in pausing mitotic progression when there are chromosome mis-attachments and in correcting those mis-attachments. At the cleavage furrow, the complex is involved in regulating the process of abscission (cell separation)",
    "annotationB": "Ran GTPase-activating protein; GTPase activator for the nuclear Ras-related regulatory protein Ran, converting it to the putatively inactive GDP-bound state (By similarity). Trans-acting factor necessary for meiotic distortion. Distortion is only seen in individuals that carry the RanGAP tandem duplication and express a RanGAP truncated protein. Binding of truncated RanGAP product to the Responder(RSP) locus initiates events that lead to sperm dysfunction",
