    "annotationA": "Phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase 59F, also known as Vacuolar protein sorting 34, is a lipid kinase that is required for formation of Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. It functions in a core protein complex that includes Atg6 and Vps15 and is involved in the control of vesicle trafficking, including autophagy, endocytosis and phagocytosis; Belongs to the PI3/PI4-kinase family",
    "annotationB": "Autophagy-related protein 13 homolog; Autophagy factor required for autophagosome formation. Target of the TOR kinase signaling pathway that regulates autophagy through the control of the phosphorylation status of Atg13 and Atg1. The Atg1-Atg13 complex functions at multiple levels to mediate and adjust nutrient-dependent autophagic signaling. Involved in the autophagic degradation of dBruce which controls DNA fragmentation in nurse cells",
