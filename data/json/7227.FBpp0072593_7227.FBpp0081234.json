Probably acts by regulating the alternative splice site selection of the otu transcript. Also regulates the alternative splicing of eIF-4E and grk, while it is not involved in the splicing of par-1, sqd and psq; Belongs to the RRM half pint family",

They function as part of the heteroheptameric ring complex Sm core, which is involved in the formation of spliceosomal small nuclear RNPs (U1, U2, U4 and U5), which together catalyze pre-mRNA splicing",
