The protein kinase activities of these complexes (CycA-Cdk1, CycB-Cdk1, CycB3-Cdk1) control important aspects of progression through the cell cycle. Functionally, the different Cdk1 complexes are partially redundant. They phosphorylate hundreds of target proteins and are most important for progression into and through mitotic and meiotic M phases; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.
