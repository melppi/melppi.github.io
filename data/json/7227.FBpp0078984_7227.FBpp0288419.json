It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Polycomb protein Sfmbt; Polycomb group (PcG) protein that binds to the Polycomb response elements (PREs) found in the regulatory regions of many genes. PcG proteins act by forming multiprotein complexes, which are required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development. PcG proteins are not required to initiate repression, but to maintain it during later stages of development. They probably act via the methylation of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. Necessary but not sufficient to recruit a functional Pc [...] ",
