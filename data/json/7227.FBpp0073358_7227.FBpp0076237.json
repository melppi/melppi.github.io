Has no activity against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Shows some partial redundancy with PRPGP-SD in Gram-positive bacteria recognition. May act by forming a complex with GNBP1 that activates the proteolytic cleavage of Spatzle and the subsequent activation of Toll pathway. Binds to diaminopimelic acid-type tetrapeptide PGN (DAP-type PGN) a [...] ",
