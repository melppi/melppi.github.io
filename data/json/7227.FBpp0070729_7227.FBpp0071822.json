The active ATPase sites in the Mcm2-7 ring are formed through the interaction surfaces of two neighboring subunits such that a critical structure of a conserved arginine finger motif is provided in trans relative to the ATP- binding site of the Walker A box of the adjacent subunit. The six ATPase active sites, however, are likely to contribu [...] ",

During late metaphase of mitosis and continuing in G1, CycB is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity, and allowing termination of mitosis",
