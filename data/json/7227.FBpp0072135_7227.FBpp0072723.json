    "annotationB": "Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase, mitochondrial; Key enzyme for ketone body catabolism. Transfers the CoA moiety from succinate to acetoacetate. Formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate proceeds via an unstable anhydride species formed between the carboxylate groups of the enzyme and substrate (By similarity); Belongs to the 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase family",
