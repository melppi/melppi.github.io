U1-C is directly involved in initial 5' splice-site recognition for both constitutive and regulated alternative splicing. The interaction with the 5' splice-site seems to precede base-pairing between the pre-mRNA and the U1 snRNA. Stimulates commitment or early (E) complex formation by stabilizing the base pairing of the 5' end of the U1 snRNA and the 5' splice-site region (By similarity). Regulat [...] ",

This complex binds to spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (e.g. U1, U2, U4 and U5) and helps to carry out pre-mRNA splicing. SmF also forms a heterotrimeric sub-complex with SmE and SNRPG",
