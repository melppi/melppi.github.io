It is involved in the biological process described with: DNA amplification; DNA replication initiation; chromosome condensation; DNA replication; positive regulation of G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle; mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint; neurogenesis; neuron projection morphogenesis",
    "annotationB": "Replication protein A 70 kDa DNA-binding subunit; As part of the heterotrimeric replication protein A complex (RPA/RP-A), binds and stabilizes single-stranded DNA intermediates, that form during DNA replication or upon DNA stress. It prevents their reannealing and in parallel, recruits and activates different proteins and complexes involved in DNA metabolism. Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage",
