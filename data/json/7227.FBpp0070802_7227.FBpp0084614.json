H2A 'Lys-118' ubiquitination gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. Polycomb group (PcG) protein. PcG proteins act by forming multiprotein complexes, which are required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development. PcG proteins are not required to initiate repression, but to maintain it during later stages of development. PcG [...] ",
