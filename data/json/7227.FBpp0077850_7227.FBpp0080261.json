    "annotationA": "Presenilin homolog; Probable catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptor. Required for S3 cleavage of Notch, which releases activated Notch protein from the cell membrane. Involved in the patterning of the optic lobes; Belongs to the peptidase A22A family",
    "annotationB": "Suppressor of hairless protein; Transcriptional regulator that plays a central role in Notch signaling, a signaling pathway involved in cell-cell communication that regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate determinations. Binds directly the 5'-GTGRGAR-3' DNA consensus sequence, which is present in the regulatory region of several genes. Required for neurogenesis in imaginal disks. Acts as a transcriptional repressor when it is not associated with Notch proteins. When associated with some Notch protein, it acts as a transcriptional activator that activates transcription of Notch target g [...] ",
