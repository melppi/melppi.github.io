Selectively required for the nuclear import of the Rel family transcription factors dorsal (dl) and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) and the activation of an immune response. Required for the anchoring of Nup214 and emb on the nuclear envelope and thereby attenuates nuclear export signal (NES)-mediated nuclear export",
