    "annotationA": "Importin subunit alpha; Pendulin (Pen) is a member of the Importin-alpha protein family, an essential adaptor in the Ran-GTP nuclear transport cycle binding a cargo protein to the nuclear import receptor Fs(2)Ket. In addition to nuclear protein import, Pendulin is involved in centrosome duplication, mitotic spindle dynamics, nuclear envelope assembly, ring canal formation in the female germline, geotaxic behaviour and perception of pain",
    "annotationB": "Ran GTPase-activating protein; GTPase activator for the nuclear Ras-related regulatory protein Ran, converting it to the putatively inactive GDP-bound state (By similarity). Trans-acting factor necessary for meiotic distortion. Distortion is only seen in individuals that carry the RanGAP tandem duplication and express a RanGAP truncated protein. Binding of truncated RanGAP product to the Responder(RSP) locus initiates events that lead to sperm dysfunction",
