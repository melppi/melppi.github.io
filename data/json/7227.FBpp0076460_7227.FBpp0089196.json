Seems to contact the pointed end of the daughter actin filament (By similarity). Required during embryogenesis for the developmental migration of tail hemocytes anteriorly, along the ventral midline",
    "annotationB": "Profilin; Binds to actin and affects the structure of the cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of IP3 and DG. This profilin is required for intercellular cytoplasm transport during Drosophila oogenesis",
