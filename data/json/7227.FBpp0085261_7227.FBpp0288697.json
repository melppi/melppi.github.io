    "annotationA": "Protein teashirt; Homeotic protein that acts downstream of Arm in the Wg cascade during embryogenesis to determine segment identity throughout the entire trunk. Acts cooperatively with other trunk homeotic proteins to repress head homeotic genes and therefore repress head segmental identity. Necessary, in combination with Scr, for the formation of the prothoracic segment. Promotes eye development in the dorsal region of the eye disk and suppresses eye development in the ventral region in combination with Wg- signaling and several early dorso-ventral eye patterning genes.

The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein Hippo (Hpo), in complex with its regulatory protein Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts) in complex with its regulatory protein Mats, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein.
