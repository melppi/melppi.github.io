    "annotationB": "Lamin Dm0; Lamins are components of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous layer on the nucleoplasmic side of the inner nuclear membrane, which is thought to provide a framework for the nuclear envelope and may also interact with chromatin. May have a role in the localization of the LEM domain proteins Ote, bocks and MAN1 to the nuclear membrane. In spermatocytes, plays a role in maintaining type-A lamin LamC nuclear localization; regulates meiotic cytokinesis by maintaining the structure of the spindle envelope, and by contributing to the formation of the contractile ring and central spindle",
