Binds, ubiquitinates and inactivates initiator caspase Dronc, and effector caspases Drice and Dcp-1. Acts as a Nedd8-E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase for Drice. Suppresses apoptosis by targeting the apoptosome for ubiquitination and inactivation. Plays an important role in cell motility. Overexpression suppresses rpr and hid-dependent cell death in the eye. Interaction of Diap1 with Dronc is required to suppress [...] ",
