    "annotationA": "Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 26; Component of the retromer complex which acts in conjunction with wingless (wg) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis to sustain a wntless (wls) traffic loop. This loop encompasses the Golgi, the cell surface, an endocytic compartment and a retrograde route leading back to the Golgi, thereby enabling wls to direct wg secretion. The hh and dpp signaling pathways do not require the retromer complex suggesting that it does not play a general role in exocytosis; Belongs to the VPS26 family",
    "annotationB": "Sorting nexin 3, isoform A; Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding. It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway; wing disc development; positive regulation of Wnt protein secretion; protein stabilization; canonical Wnt signaling pathway; regulation of Wnt signaling pathway by Wnt protein secretion; intracellular protein transport; Wnt protein secretion",
