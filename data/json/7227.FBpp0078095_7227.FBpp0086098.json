Acts by directing the binding of methionyl-tRNAi to 40S ribosomal subunits. In contrast to the eIF- 2 complex, it binds methionyl-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a codon- dependent manner, whereas the eIF-2 complex binds methionyl-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a GTP-dependent manner. May act by impiging the expression of specific proteins (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit B; RNA-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is involved in protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs and, together with other initiation factors, stimulates binding of mRNA and methionyl-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation",
