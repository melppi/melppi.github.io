Subsequently, molybdate is inserted into adenylated molybdopterin and AMP is released; In the N-terminal section; belongs to the MoaB/Mog family",
    "annotationB": "Molybdopterin synthase catalytic subunit; Catalytic subunit of the molybdopterin synthase complex, a complex that catalyzes the conversion of precursor Z into molybdopterin. Acts by mediating the incorporation of 2 sulfur atoms from thiocarboxylated MOCS2A into precursor Z to generate a dithiolene group; Belongs to the MoaE family. MOCS2B subfamily",
