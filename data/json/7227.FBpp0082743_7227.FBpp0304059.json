    "annotationA": "COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5; Probable protease subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has no metalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunits of  [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin specific protease 14 (Usp14) is a deubiquitinase that associates with the 19S component of the proteasome in a reversible manner. Usp14 functions include ubiquitin chain disassemblance for mono-ubiquitin recycling, control of protein degradation by the proteasome and regulation of proteasome subtrate interactions; Belongs to the peptidase C19 family",
