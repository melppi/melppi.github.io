Specific for 5'-overhanging flap structures in which the 5'- upstream of the flap is completely double-stranded. Prefers the blocked-flap structures similar to those occurring at replication forks, in which the 5' single-strand overhang of the flap is double-stranded. Also possesses weak 5'- to 3'-exonuclease activity on nicked but not gapped double-stranded DNA. Does not cleave bubble-like or Holliday junction substrates",
