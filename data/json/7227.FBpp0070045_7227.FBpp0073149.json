HOPS tethers autophagosomes or late endosomes with lysosomes to facilitate fusion. Vps11 roles include autophagosome-lysosome fusion, late endosome-lysosome fusion and biosynthetic trafficking to lysosomes",

It mediates the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes and lysosomes by forming a SNARE complex with Snap29 (Qbc) and Vamp7 (R). Syx17 roles include autophagosome clearance and neuromuscular function",
