    "annotationA": "H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 3; Required for ribosome biogenesis. Part of a complex which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Pseudouridine (\"psi\") residues may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs (By similarity); Belongs to the NOP10 family",
    "annotationB": "Probable DNA-directed RNA polymerases I and III subunit RPAC2; DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common core component of RNA polymerases I and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors and small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively (By similarity); Belongs to the archaeal RpoL/eukaryotic RPB11/RPC19 RNA polymerase subunit family",
