It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",

Actively displaces NLSs from importin-alpha, and facilitates disassembly of the importin-alpha:beta-cargo complex and importin recycling (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active chromatin sites when located in the nucleoplasm and is involved in transcriptional activation",
