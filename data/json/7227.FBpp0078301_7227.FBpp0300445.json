Involved in multiple cellular processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, alternative splicing, rRNA processing and miRNA processing, as well as transcription regulation (By similarity). Plays a role in innate immunity. Specifically restricts bunyavirus infection, including Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) or La Crosse virus (LACV), but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in an interferon- and DROSHA-independent manner",

Plays a role as a negative translational regulator of specific mRNAs. Represses translation of the microtubule-associated protein futsch mRNA to regulate microtubule-dependent synaptic growth and function. May also be involved in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational suppression. Required for stability of the central pair of microtubules in the spermatid axoneme. Regulates photoreceptor  [...] ",
