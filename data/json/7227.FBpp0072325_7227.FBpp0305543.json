Regulates dorsoventral axis formation during early development by inhibiting the serine protease easter, and is therefore important for restricting activity of the Toll signaling pathway to the ventral part of the embryo. Also plays an essential role in the melanization immune response to both physical wounding and septic infection using certain bacteria and fungi.
