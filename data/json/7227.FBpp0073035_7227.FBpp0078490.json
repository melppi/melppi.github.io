When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradatio [...] ",

Involved in the negative regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway in the wing by acting with the putative E3 ligases poe, Kcmf1 and Ufd4 to mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of rl/MAPK; Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family",
