    "annotationA": "Small ubiquitin-related modifier; Smt3 is the only Drosophila SUMO family protein. It is required for embryonic patterning and mitosis. It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore glycoprotein p62; Essential component of the nuclear pore complex (By similarity). The N-terminal is probably involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (By similarity). The C-terminal is involved in protein-protein interaction probably via coiled-coil formation, promotes its association with centrosomes and may function in anchorage of Nup62 to the pore complex (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active genes. Negatively regulates chromatin attachment to the nuclear envelope, probably by preventing chromatin tethering by Nup154",
