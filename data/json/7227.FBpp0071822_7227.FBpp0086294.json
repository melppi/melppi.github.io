    "annotationA": "G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-B; Cyclin B (CycB) binds to Cdk1, thereby promoting Cdk1's protein kinase activity. The complex CycB-Cdk1 complex induces the start of mitosis. During late metaphase of mitosis and continuing in G1, CycB is rapidly degraded (involving APC/C and the proteasome), resulting in inactivation of Cdk1 protein kinase activity, and allowing termination of mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore glycoprotein p62; Essential component of the nuclear pore complex (By similarity). The N-terminal is probably involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (By similarity). The C-terminal is involved in protein-protein interaction probably via coiled-coil formation, promotes its association with centrosomes and may function in anchorage of Nup62 to the pore complex (By similarity). Binds to transcriptionally active genes. Negatively regulates chromatin attachment to the nuclear envelope, probably by preventing chromatin tethering by Nup154",
