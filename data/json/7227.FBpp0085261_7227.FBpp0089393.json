    "annotationA": "Protein teashirt; Homeotic protein that acts downstream of Arm in the Wg cascade during embryogenesis to determine segment identity throughout the entire trunk. Acts cooperatively with other trunk homeotic proteins to repress head homeotic genes and therefore repress head segmental identity. Necessary, in combination with Scr, for the formation of the prothoracic segment. Promotes eye development in the dorsal region of the eye disk and suppresses eye development in the ventral region in combination with Wg- signaling and several early dorso-ventral eye patterning genes. Required for p [...] ",

Controls the segmental transformation of the first to the second thoracic segment (prothorax to mesothorax) and of the labial palps into maxillary palps. In embryo, required for fusion of labial lobes and development of the T1 denticle belt. In adult, expression in the head is necessary for proper development of the labium. In the first thoracic segment of the adult, required [...] ",
