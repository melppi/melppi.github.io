Its phosphorylation through the Rho-Rho Kinase pathway is predicted to activate myosin motor activity. Sqh and myosin function in cellular processes such as cytokinesis, and also contribute to tissue morphogenesis",
    "annotationB": "Frizzled; Receptor for Wnt proteins. Most of frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK- 3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase. Both pathways seem to in [...] ",
