    "annotationA": "Vacuolar protein sorting 4, isoform A; ATP binding; ATPase activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: phagocytosis; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway; negative regulation of growth of symbiont in host; negative regulation of Notch signaling pathway; establishment or maintenance of epithelial cell apical/basal polarity; actin cytoskeleton organization; autophagic vacuole fusion; intracellular protein transport",
    "annotationB": "Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; Essential role in endosome membrane invagination and formation of multivesicular bodies, MVBs. Required during gastrulation and appears to regulate early embryonic signaling pathways. Inhibits tyrosine kinase receptor signaling by promoting degradation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated, active receptor, potentially by sorting activated receptors into MVBs. The MVBs are then trafficked to the lysosome where their contents are degraded",
