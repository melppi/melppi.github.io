Furthermore, the intestinal copper importer Ctr1B, which is regulated by copper demand, fails to be induced upon copper starvation in Atox1-/- larvae, while intestinal metallothionein is upregulated. This suggests intestinal copper accumulation, combined with insufficient delivery to the rest of the body",
