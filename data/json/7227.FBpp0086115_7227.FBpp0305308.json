It is involved in the biological process described with: mitotic nuclear division; muscle organ development; chromatin remodeling; mitotic cytokinesis; positive regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; dendrite guidance; DNA repair; dendrite morphogenesis; positive regulation of gene silencing by miRNA; Belongs to the actin family",
    "annotationB": "Barrier-to-autointegration factor; Plays fundamental roles in nuclear assembly, chromatin organization, gene expression and gonad development. May potently compress chromatin structure and be involved in membrane recruitment and chromatin decondensation during nuclear assembly. Functions are required in both M phase and interphase of the cell cycle; Belongs to the BAF family",
