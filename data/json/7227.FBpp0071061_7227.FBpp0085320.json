Contributes to endodermal integrity and adhesion between the midgut epithelium and the surrounding visceral muscle. Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium. The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/talin and Itgbn does not. Required for rhea/talin correct cellular localization in the midgut.

Together with drpr and shark, promotes the migration of macrophages to sites of wounding as part of a signaling cascade where Scr42a detects production of hydrogen peroxide at wound sites which triggers phosphorylation of drpr and subsequent recruitment and activation of shark.
