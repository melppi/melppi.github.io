The muscle isoform has a role in muscle development while the non-muscle isoform localizes to ovarian ring canals and has a role in cytoskeletal remodeling of follicle cells; Belongs to the alpha-actinin family",
    "annotationB": "Paxillin, isoform F; Paxillin (Pax) is an adaptor protein that is generally associated with integrins. It is not required for most integrin-mediated adhesion or migration events, but is required for viability beyond pupal stages. Pax controls the size of some muscles by regulating the rate of cell fusion",
