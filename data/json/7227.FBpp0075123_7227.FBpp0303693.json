    "annotationA": "Female-specific protein transformer; Member of the regulatory pathway controlling female somatic sexual differentiation, regulated by Sxl. Activates dsx female-specific splicing by promoting the formation of a splicing enhancer complex which consists of tra, tra2 and sr proteins. Together with tra-2, plays a role in switching fru splicing from the male-specific pattern to the female-specific pattern through activation of the female-specific fru 5'-splice site. No known function in males",
    "annotationB": "Protein sex-lethal; Sex determination switch protein which controls sexual development by sex-specific splicing. Regulates dosage compensation in females by suppressing hyperactivation of X-linked genes. Expression of the embryo-specific isoform is under the control of primary sex-determining signal, which depends on the ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes (X:A ratio). Expression occurs in 2X:2A cells, but not in X:2A cells. The X:A ratio seems to be signaled by the relative concentration of the X- linked transcription factors SIS-A and SIS-B. As a result, the embryo-specific  [...] ",
