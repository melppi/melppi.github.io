    "annotationB": "Protein Vhl; Involved in development of tracheal vasculature. Probably involved in halting cell migration at the end of vascular tube outgrowth. Possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity when in complex with Elongin BC complex, Cul2 and Rox1a/Rbx1, and can target sima/Hif1a for ubiquitination. May play a critical role in promoting microtubule stabilization when tubulins are correctly folded by the prefoldin complex. If tubulin is incorrectly folded, may promote its degradation",
