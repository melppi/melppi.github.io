Has endonuclease activity. Binds RNA polymers with a preference for G- and/or C-rich clusters. Binds single-stranded DNA non-specifically",
    "annotationB": "Polyadenylate-binding protein 2; Involved in the 3'-end formation of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA) by the addition of a poly(A) tail of 200-250 nt to the upstream cleavage product. Stimulates poly(A) polymerase (PAPOLA) conferring processivity on the poly(A) tail elongation reaction and controls also the poly(A) tail length (By similarity). Increases the affinity of poly(A) polymerase for RNA (By similarity). Binds to poly(A) and to poly(G) with high affinity. May protect the poly(A) tail from degradation (By similarity). Plays a role in the positive regulation of alpha-1,3 fucosylation,  [...] ",
