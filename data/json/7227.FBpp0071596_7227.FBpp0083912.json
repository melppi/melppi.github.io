    "annotationA": "TATA binding protein is a basal transcription factor required at most RNA Pol I and Pol II-transcribed genes in Drosophila. Traditionally thought to be recruited only to TATA box containing promoters, recent work shows that promoters with very weak TATA box consensus sequences also recruit TBP as a part of the multisubunit TFIID basal transcription factor or via the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex",
    "annotationB": "Transcription initiation factor IIA subunit 2; TFIIA is a component of the transcription machinery of RNA polymerase II and plays an important role in transcriptional activation. TFIIA in a complex with TBP mediates transcriptional activity. Part of a rhi-dependent transcription machinery that enables the generation of piRNA precursors from heterochromatin while maintaining the suppression of transposon-encoded promoters and enhancers. Forms a complex with Moonshiner/CG12721 and Trf2 which recruit transcriptional machinery to heterochromatin to initiate the bidirectional transcription  [...] ",
