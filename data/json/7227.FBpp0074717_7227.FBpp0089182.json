The Gbeta-gamma complex plays an essential role in phototransduction by presenting the Gqalpha-subunit to rhodopsin GPCRs for efficient activation, and preventing spontaneous GDP-GTP exchange on the Gqalpha-subunit",
    "annotationB": "Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-1; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein- effector interaction",
