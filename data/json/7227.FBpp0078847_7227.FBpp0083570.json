It is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport complex I, which is part of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. It may have a role in regulating aggression behavior",
    "annotationB": "NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10, mitochondrial; Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone (By similarity)",
