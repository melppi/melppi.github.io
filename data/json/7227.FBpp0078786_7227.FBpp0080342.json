    "annotationB": "Seminal metalloprotease-1 (Semp1) is a metalloprotease that is produced by male accessory glands and transferred to females during mating. It is cleavage activated during mating, first by Sems and then by auto-catalysis. Semp1 also cleaves at least two other seminal proteins, Acp26Aa and Acp36DE, in the mated female; Belongs to the peptidase M12A family",
