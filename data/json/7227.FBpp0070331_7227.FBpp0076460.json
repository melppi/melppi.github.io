    "annotationA": "Alpha-actinin, sarcomeric; Alpha Actinin (Actn) is an actin cross-linking protein with muscle and non-muscle specific isoforms, which are produced by alternative spicing. The muscle isoform has a role in muscle development while the non-muscle isoform localizes to ovarian ring canals and has a role in cytoskeletal remodeling of follicle cells; Belongs to the alpha-actinin family",
    "annotationB": "Actin-related protein 3; Functions as ATP-binding component of the Arp2/3 complex which is involved in regulation of actin polymerization and together with an activating nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) mediates the formation of branched actin networks (By similarity). Seems to contact the pointed end of the daughter actin filament (By similarity). Required during embryogenesis for the developmental migration of tail hemocytes anteriorly, along the ventral midline",
