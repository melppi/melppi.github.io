Required during gastrulation and appears to regulate early embryonic signaling pathways. Inhibits tyrosine kinase receptor signaling by promoting degradation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated, active receptor, potentially by sorting activated receptors into MVBs. The MVBs are then trafficked to the lysosome where their contents are degraded",
