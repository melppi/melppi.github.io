    "annotationA": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk) is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity depends on the regulatory CycH and Mat1 subunits. This trimeric Cdk complex activates other Cdks by phosphorylation in their T-loop and is called Cdk activating kinase (CAK). CAK can also be part of TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates different transcription substrates (e.g. CTD of Pol II)",
    "annotationB": "Suppressor of stem-loop mutation, isoform A; Zinc ion binding; core RNA polymerase binding transcription factor activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter; transcriptional open complex formation at RNA polymerase II promoter; nucleotide-excision repair; promoter clearance from RNA polymerase II promoter; transcription initiation from RNA polymerase II promoter",
