The muscle isoform has a role in muscle development while the non-muscle isoform localizes to ovarian ring canals and has a role in cytoskeletal remodeling of follicle cells; Belongs to the alpha-actinin family",
    "annotationB": "Profilin; Binds to actin and affects the structure of the cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of IP3 and DG. This profilin is required for intercellular cytoplasm transport during Drosophila oogenesis",
