    "annotationA": "Protein male-specific lethal-1; The Msl proteins are essential for elevating transcription of the single X chromosome in the male (X chromosome dosage compensation). Msl-1 is a pioneer protein. Mle, msl-1 and msl-3 are colocalized on the X chromosome. Each of the MSL proteins requires all the other MSLs for wild-type X-chromosome binding. In complex with msl-2, promotes ubiquitination of histone H2B",
    "annotationB": "DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1; Involved in transcription repression and activation (By similarity). Required for larvae and pupal development, and for normal innate immune responses. Involved in modulating the activation of the immune deficiency pathway (Imd), acting either downstream of, or at the level of, the NF-kappa-B factor Rel. Possibly functions with akirin to regulate Rel, and its interaction with the Brahma complex protein Bap55 suggests that it may regulate the IMD pathway at the level of chromatin remodeling",
