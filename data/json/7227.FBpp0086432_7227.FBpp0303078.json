Promotes cytoplasmic cleavage of Rel and its translocation to the nucleus where it drives expression of antimicrobial peptides. Binds, polyubiquitinates and activates Dredd which is required for Rel-mediated induction of antimicrobial peptides.

Promotes or induces cell death either by direct binding to and inhibition of BIRC proteins (also called inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs), leading to an increase in caspase activity, or by a BIRC inhibition-independent, caspase-independent and serine protease activity-dependent mechanism.
