Traditionally thought to be recruited only to TATA box containing promoters, recent work shows that promoters with very weak TATA box consensus sequences also recruit TBP as a part of the multisubunit TFIID basal transcription factor or via the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex",
    "annotationB": "Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (Mbf1) is a transcriptional co-activator that bridges between sequence-specific transcriptional regulators and Tbp. Under stress, cytoplasmic Mbf1 can translocate into the nucleus and serve as a co-activator to induce stress-reponse genes",
