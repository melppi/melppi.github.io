    "annotationA": "Protein LST8 homolog; Subunit of TORC1 and TORC2, which regulate cell growth and survival in response to nutrient and hormonal signals. Essential for TORC2-mediated regulation of cell growth and phosphorylation of Akt1. However it is not required for TORC1-mediated functions such as TORC1-dependent regulation of cell growth, autophagy and phosphorylation of S6K; Belongs to the WD repeat LST8 family",
    "annotationB": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-3 (eIF4E-3) binds the 7-methyl-guanosine cap structure of mRNA. It is a component of the eIF4F cap-binding complex that is essential for cap-dependent translation of mRNA. eIF4E-3 is primarily expressed in testes and is required for male fertility, but not for viability",
