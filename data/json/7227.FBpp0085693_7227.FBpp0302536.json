H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression by recruiting Su(var)205/HP1 to methylated histones. Mainly functions in heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin at pericentric regions.
