The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity; Belongs to the peptidase T1A family",
    "annotationB": "E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Su(dx); E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates. Down-regulates Notch/N signaling pathway, probably by promoting Notch ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation. Involved in wing growth and leg joint formation",
