Coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins",

Specifically required during early embryogenesis for the activity of maternal tkv, while the zygotic tkv is not affected; Belongs to the EMP24/GP25L family",
