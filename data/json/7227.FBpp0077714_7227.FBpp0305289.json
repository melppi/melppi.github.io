    "annotationA": "DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA2; DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Second largest core component of RNA polymerase I which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol I is composed of mobile elements and RPA2 is part of the core element with the central large cleft and probably a clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 2-like protein; Required for ribosome biogenesis. Part of a complex which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Pseudouridine (\"psi\") residues may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs (By similarity)",
