    "annotationA": "F-box/SPRY domain-containing protein 1; Required in the presynaptic motoneuron to down-regulate the levels of wnd and restrain synaptic terminal growth at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Negatively regulates the localization of vas to the posterior pole of the oocyte. Involved in primordial germ cell formation; Belongs to the FBXO45/Fsn family",
    "annotationB": "Cullin homolog 1; Core component of multiple SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which mediate the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. In the SCF complex, serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the SKP1-F-box protein and RBX1 subunits. May contribute to catalysis through positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. During early metamorphosis, part of the SCF-slmb complex that negatively regulates the InR/PI3K/TOR pathway to activate the pruning of unnecessary larva [...] ",
