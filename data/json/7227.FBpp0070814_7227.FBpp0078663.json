It can both act as a peptide transferase that transfers GalNAc onto unmodified peptide substrates, and as a glycopeptide transferase that requires the prior addition of a GalNAc on a peptide before adding additional GalNAc moieties. Prefers EA2 as substrate; Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family. GalNAc-T subfamily",
