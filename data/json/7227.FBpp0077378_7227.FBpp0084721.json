The Arp2/3 complex is required for many cellular and developmental processes requiring F-actin polymerization, including germline ring canal growth, embryonic cellularization, myoblast fusion, and endocytosis",

WASp enables the Arp2/3 complex to nucleate polymerization of branched microfilament arrays and contributes to gastrulation, myoblast fusion, synapse morphology at neuromuscular junctions, sensory organ development, and spermatogenesis",
