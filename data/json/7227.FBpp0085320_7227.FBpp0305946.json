    "annotationA": "Tyrosine-protein kinase Src42A; Required directly or indirectly for the phosphorylation of drpr which is necessary for the interaction of drpr with shark and subsequent glial phagocytic activity. Together with drpr and shark, promotes the migration of macrophages to sites of wounding as part of a signaling cascade where Scr42a detects production of hydrogen peroxide at wound sites which triggers phosphorylation of drpr and subsequent recruitment and activation of shark. Essential for correct eye morphogenesis (ommatidial R7 neuron formation) which requires the Ras1/MAPK signal transduc [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Raf homolog serine/threonine-protein kinase phl; Serine/threonine kinase required in the early embryo for the formation of terminal structure. Also required during the proliferation of imaginal cells. May act downstream of Ras85D in the tor signal transduction pathway. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, an hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis",
