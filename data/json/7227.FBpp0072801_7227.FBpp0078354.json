It is involved in the biological process described with: regulation of cell size; insulin receptor signaling pathway; mitotic spindle elongation; translation; compound eye development; centrosome duplication; mitotic spindle organization",
    "annotationB": "Ribosomal protein L13A (RpL13A) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit, and thus involved in mRNA translation. Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins affect fertility, viability and other Drosophila phenotypes, described as Minute. Extra-ribosomal roles for RpL13A have been described in some organisms; Belongs to the universal ribosomal protein uL13 family",
