    "annotationB": "Protein deadpan; Transcriptional repressor of genes that require a bHLH protein for their transcription. Likely to be involved in the functional rather than the morphological differentiation of neurons. Loss of DPN function results in weak motor activity, lethargic behavior, and death. Implicated in sex determination as Groucho-DPN complex act directly to repress SXL transcription",
