The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin specific protease 14 (Usp14) is a deubiquitinase that associates with the 19S component of the proteasome in a reversible manner. Usp14 functions include ubiquitin chain disassemblance for mono-ubiquitin recycling, control of protein degradation by the proteasome and regulation of proteasome subtrate interactions; Belongs to the peptidase C19 family",
