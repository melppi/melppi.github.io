    "annotationA": "Cell division control protein; Cdc6 is an essential component of the pre-Replication complex (preRC) together with the origin recognition complex, dup and MCM2-7 proteins. The preRC is present at all chromosomal origins of replication and is required for the initiation of DNA replication. Cdc6 also functions in the co-ordination of DNA replication with mitosis, and may contribute to apoptosis and transcription",
    "annotationB": "Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S; Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by specifically elongating polyubiquitin chains initiated by the E2 enzyme vih/UbcH10 on APC/C substrates, enhancing the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit",
