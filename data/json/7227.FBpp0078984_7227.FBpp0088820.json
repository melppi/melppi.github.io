It may also have roles in wing patterning, Dpp signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase  and to the kinetochores and midbodies during mitosis",
    "annotationB": "Nuclear pore complex protein Nup154; Component of the nuclear pore complex. Has a role in the organization of the inner nuclear membrane proteins at the nuclear envelope. In germ cells, plays a role in the nuclear localization of components of the dpp signaling pathways, such as Medea and phosphorylated Mad. Binds to chromatin, and together with Nup62 and Nup93-1, contributes to karyosome morphology and chromatin organization including attachment to the nuclear envelope in oocytes and nurse cells. Has a role in female fertility including egg chamber development; in nurse cells, has a r [...] ",
