Required downstream of phl/Raf in the sev/sevenless, tor/torso, and EGF receptor homolog Egfr signal transduction pathways. Required for embryonic epithelial tissue repair. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, a hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis; Belongs to the protein kinase [...] ",
