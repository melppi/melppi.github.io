Component of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) system also called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Also promotes the degradation of normal but naturally short-lived proteins. Protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Sequesters p53 in the cytoplasm and prom [...] ",
