    "annotationA": "Protein spartin; During postembryonic development, functions with endocytic adapter Eps-15 in neurons to restrain synaptic growth, by inhibiting BMP signaling, and to control synaptic endocytosis. Required presynaptically for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) neurotransmission. Inhibits neuronal BMP signaling by promoting endocytic internalization and subsequent endosomal trafficking of the BMP receptor wit. In this way, regulates the Fmr1 translational regulator controlling Futsch expression to modulate neuronal microtubule stability, which controls both synaptogenesis and neuronal survival",
    "annotationB": "Spastin; ATP-dependent microtubule severing protein. Stimulates microtubule minus-end depolymerization and poleward microtubule flux in the mitotic spindle. Regulates microtubule stability in the neuromuscular junction synapse. Involved in lipid metabolism by regulating the size and distribution of lipid droplets. Involved in axon regeneration by regulating microtubule severing; Belongs to the AAA ATPase family. Spastin subfamily",
