Plays a role in eye development by regulating cell growth, survival of postmitotic ommatidial cells and differentiation of photoreceptor cells. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, a hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis",
    "annotationB": "Lethal(2) giant larvae protein; Essential for the development of polarized epithelia, for cell polarity associated with asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts during development, and for oocyte polarity formation. Promotes the formation of actin-rich projections at the oocyte cortex and the posterior enrichment of par-1 which is required for oocyte polarization. Regulates the localization of axis-specifying morphogens such as stau and grk",
