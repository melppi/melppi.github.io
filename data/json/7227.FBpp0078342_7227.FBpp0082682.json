    "annotationA": "GTP-binding protein Rheb homolog; Binds GTP and exhibits intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). Activates the protein kinase activity of TORC1, and thereby plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Stimulates the phosphorylation of S6K through activation of TORC1 signaling. May also have a role in activating TORC2 signaling",
    "annotationB": "RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase; Serine/threonine kinase involved in various developmental processes. During early embryogenesis, acts as a survival protein. During mid-embryogenesis, phosphorylates and activates trh, a transcription factor required for tracheal cell fate determination. Also regulates tracheal cell migration. Later in development, acts downstream of PI3K and Pk61C/PDK1 in the insulin receptor transduction pathway which regulates cell growth and organ size, by phosphorylating and antagonizing FOXO transcription factor. Controls follicle cell size during oogenesis. M [...] ",
