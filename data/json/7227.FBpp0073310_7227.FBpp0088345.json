Plays a role in wingless (wg) signaling, possibly through the reception of the wg signal by target cells and subsequent redistribution of arm protein in response to that signal in embryos. This signal seems to be required to establish planar cell polarity and identity",
    "annotationB": "Protein Wnt-4; Binds as a ligand to a family of frizzled seven- transmembrane receptors and acts through a cascade of genes on the nucleus. Acts downstream of homeotic complex genes in the visceral mesoderm and is required for embryonic segmentation. Also required for cell movement and FAK regulation during ovarian morphogenesis",
