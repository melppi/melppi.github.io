    "annotationA": "General odorant-binding protein lush; Odorant-binding protein required for olfactory behavior and for activity of pheromone-sensitive neurons. Binds to alcohols and mediates avoidance behavior to high concentrations of alcohols, the alcohol-binding possibly resulting in activation of receptors on T2B neurons, the activation of these receptors inhibiting these neurons. Acts in concert with Snmp and lush to capture cVA molecules on the surface of Or67d expressing olfactory dendrites and facilitate their transfer to the odorant-receptor Orco complex. Required for cVA response, probably by [...] ",

Acts in concert with Snmp and lush to capture cVA molecules on the surface of Or67d expressing olfactory dendrites and facilitate their transfer to the odorant- receptor Orco complex. Necessary to mediate behavioral responses to cVA by regulating both male and female mating behavior. Activation of Or67d neurons by cVA inhibits courtship of other males, whereas in females their activation promotes receptivity to oth [...] ",
