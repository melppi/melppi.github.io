Binds initially to sperm where it is later cleaved to release an active peptide within the female reproductive tract. Signals via the sex peptide receptor (SPR) in female flies; may also act via other receptors. Moderates the activity of distinct neuronal circuitries in the female genital tract to promote specific PMRs including: enhanced ovulation, increased egg laying rate, increased feeding/foraging rate, induced antimicrobial pe [...] ",
