    "annotationA": "Ras-like protein 1; Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). Plays a role in eye development by regulating cell growth, survival of postmitotic ommatidial cells and differentiation of photoreceptor cells. During larval development, mediates Ptth/tor signaling leading to the production of ecdysone, a hormone required for the initiation of metamorphosis",
    "annotationB": "Protein enhancer of sevenless 2B; Required for proper signaling by sevenless. May act to stimulate the ability of Sos to catalyze Ras1 activation by linking sevenless and Sos in a signaling complex; Belongs to the GRB2/sem-5/DRK family",
