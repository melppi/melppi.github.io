May be a growth factor. Acts on neighboring cells to regulate at least one gene, the homeobox segmentation gene engrailed. Wg signal represses arm phosphorylation. Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of engrailed autoactivation. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation. Wg also acts in the developing epidermis. Acts as a morphogen, [...] ",
    "annotationB": "Axin (Axn) is the key scaffolding protein for the canonical Wnt signalling pathway. In the absence of signal, Axin targets arm for proteolysis inhibiting Wnt signalling. In the presence of signal, it forms a part of the membrane activation complex, disrupting arm degradation. This pathway play roles in cell proliferation (imaginal disc), differentiation (embryonic patterning), death and stemness",
