    "annotationA": "Brahma-associated protein of 60 kDa; Involved in the recruitment and site-specific anchoring of the Brahma complex at specific promoter sites. The Brahma complex is a multiprotein complex which is the equivalent of the yeast SWI/SNF complex and acts by remodeling the chromatin by catalyzing an ATP-dependent alteration in the structure of nucleosomal DNA. This complex can both serve as a transcriptional coactivator or corepressor, depending on the context. Participates in X-chromosomal dosage compensation",
    "annotationB": "Akirin; Required for embryonic development and for normal innate immune response. Effector of immune deficiency pathway (Imd) acting either downstream of, or at the level of, the NF-kappa-B factor Relish (Rel). Not part of the Toll pathway; Belongs to the akirin family",
