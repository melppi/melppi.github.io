    "annotationA": "7-methylguanosine phosphate-specific 5'-nucleotidase; Specifically hydrolyzes 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (m(7)GMP) to 7-methylguanosine and inorganic phosphate. Also able to mediate hydrolysis of diphosphate (m(7)GDP) to 7-methylguanosine and 2 inorganic phosphate with lower activity. The specific activity for m(7)GMP may protect cells against undesired salvage of m(7)GMP and its incorporation into nucleic acids. Also has weak activity for CMP. UMP and purine nucleotides are poor substrates; Belongs to the pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase family",
    "annotationB": "Uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase; Orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase activity; orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activity. It is involved in the biological process described with: 'de novo' pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthetic process; 'de novo' UMP biosynthetic process; In the N-terminal section; belongs to the purine/pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase family",
