    "annotationA": "Reduction in Cnn dots 5 (Rcd5) belongs to the family of forkhead-associated domain proteins. As part of the Non-Specific Lethal complex, it regulates transcription of housekeeping genes by facilitating recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters. During mitosis it plays a key role in chromosomal-dependent microtubule assembly, centriole duplication and pericentriolar material maturation",
    "annotationB": "Male-specific lethal 3 is a chromodomain protein, reported to interact with H3K36me3, H4K20me1 and DNA. It is a member of the Male-Specific-Lethal dosage compensation complex, which increases male X chromosome transcription approximately two-fold. Homozygous mutant males die as larvae, while females are viable",
