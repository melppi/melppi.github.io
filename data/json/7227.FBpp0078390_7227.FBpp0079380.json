    "annotationA": "Regulator of gene activity; Component of the CCR4-NOT complex which is one of the major cellular mRNA deadenylases and is linked to various cellular processes including bulk mRNA degradation, miRNA-mediated repression, translational repression during translational initiation and general transcription regulation. Additional complex functions may be a consequence of its influence on mRNA expression. Essential for viability. Acts as a suppressor of position effect variegation (PEV) at the white locus and regulates the expression of several unrelated genes",
