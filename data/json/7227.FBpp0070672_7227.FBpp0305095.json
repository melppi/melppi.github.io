It homodimerizes and binds to a variety of proteins. It is involved in both dynein-dependent and independent functions such as cell viability, axonal guidance, spermatid growth and individualization, and regulation of spermatogonial divisions; Belongs to the dynein light chain family",
    "annotationB": "Heat shock protein 83; Molecular chaperone that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance and proper regulation of specific target proteins involved for instance in cell cycle control and signal transduction. Undergoes a functional cycle that is linked to its ATPase activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function. Together with Hop and piwi, mediates canalization, also known as developm [...] ",
