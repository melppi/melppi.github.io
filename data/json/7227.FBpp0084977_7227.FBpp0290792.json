It is expressed in the fat body during the systemic immune response and in various epithelia, and it is regulated at the transcriptional level, mostly by the Immune Deficiency pathway; Belongs to the cecropin family",
    "annotationB": "Dorsal-related immunity factor Dif; Mediates an immune response in larvae. DIF binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of the immunity gene CECA1. Involved in the melanization immune response to bacterial challenge, possibly by acting in a Toll signaling pathway that downregulates Spn27A in response to infection. Part of a signaling pathway involving NF-kappa- B (rel) and Toll-related receptors, that functions in the apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition. May be part of a NF-kappa-B and Tollo signaling cascade that regulates de [...] ",
