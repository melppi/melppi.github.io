    "annotationA": "Brahma-associated protein of 60 kDa; Involved in the recruitment and site-specific anchoring of the Brahma complex at specific promoter sites. The Brahma complex is a multiprotein complex which is the equivalent of the yeast SWI/SNF complex and acts by remodeling the chromatin by catalyzing an ATP-dependent alteration in the structure of nucleosomal DNA. This complex can both serve as a transcriptional coactivator or corepressor, depending on the context. Participates in X-chromosomal dosage compensation",
    "annotationB": "RuvB-like helicase 1; Acts as a transcriptional coactivator in Wg signaling caused by altered arm signaling. Pont and rept interfere antagonistically with nuclear arm signaling function, and are required to enhance or reduce arm activity, respectively. Also an essential cofactor for the normal function of Myc; required for cellular proliferation and growth",
