    "annotationA": "Dynein light chain 1, cytoplasmic; Cut up (Ctp) is the 8 kDa (LC8/DLC1) subunit of the cytoplasmic Dynein, as well as the Myosin V. It homodimerizes and binds to a variety of proteins. It is involved in both dynein-dependent and independent functions such as cell viability, axonal guidance, spermatid growth and individualization, and regulation of spermatogonial divisions; Belongs to the dynein light chain family",
    "annotationB": "Dynactin 1, p150 subunit (DCTN1-p150) is the p150 subunit of the dynactin complex. Dynactin is thought to act as a dynein receptor that modulates binding of dynein to cellular cargoes and enhances the processivity of dynein movement. DCTN1-p150 roles include oocyte polarity, mitotic cell division, embryonic development, neuronal transport and neurogenesis",
