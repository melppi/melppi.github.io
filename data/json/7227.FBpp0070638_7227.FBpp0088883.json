    "annotationA": "DNA repair protein complementing XP-A cells homolog; Involved in DNA excision repair. Initiates repair by binding to damaged sites with various affinities, depending on the photoproduct and the transcriptional state of the region (By similarity); Belongs to the XPA family",
    "annotationB": "Endonuclease III homolog; Bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase with associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase function that catalyzes the first step in base excision repair (BER), the primary repair pathway for the repair of oxidative DNA damage. The DNA N-glycosylase activity releases the damaged DNA base from DNA by cleaving the N- glycosidic bond, leaving an AP site. The AP lyase activity cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3' to the AP site by a beta-elimination. Primarily recognizes and repairs oxidative base damage of pyrimidines; Belongs to the Nth/MutY family",
