It prevents their reannealing and in parallel, recruits and activates different proteins and complexes involved in DNA metabolism. Thereby, it plays an essential role both in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage",
    "annotationB": "DNA repair protein Rad51 homolog; Spindle A forms a filament on single-stranded DNA, does a homology search of double-stranded DNA, and catalyzes strand exchange, swapping the single-strand DNA in and displacing the partner of the complementary strand",
