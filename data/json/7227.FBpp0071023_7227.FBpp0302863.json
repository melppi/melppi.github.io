Conjugation with Atg12, through a ubiquitin-like conjugating system involving Atg7 as an E1-like activating enzyme and Atg10 as an E2-like conjugating enzyme, is essential for its function. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate acts as an E3-like enzyme which is required for lipidation of Atg8 and its association to the vesicle membranes (By similarity)",
