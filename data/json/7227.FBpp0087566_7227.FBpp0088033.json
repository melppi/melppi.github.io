DNA-binding is ATP-dependent, however specific DNA sequences that define origins of replication have not been identified so far. ORC is required to assemble the pre-replication complex necessary to initiate DNA replication (By similarity)",
    "annotationB": "Origin recognition complex subunit 1 (Orc1) is the largest subunit of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The ATPase activity of Orc1 is critical for the formation and function of the pre-replicative complex. The regulated degradation of Orc1 by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis after initiation of DNA replication helps to prevent re-replication",
