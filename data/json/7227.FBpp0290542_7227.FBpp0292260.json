In epithelial tissues, CASK functions as an adhesion molecule involved in cell proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration. In neurons, CASK serves as a scaffold for a number of signaling and transmembrane molecules and is involved in synaptic development and plasticity; In the N-terminal section; belongs to the protein kinase superfamily.

Essential for embryonic viability and development. Required for coordinated peristaltic contractions.
